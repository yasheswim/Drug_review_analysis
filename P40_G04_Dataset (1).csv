Abilify,Depression,"I started taking Abilify to compliment years of taking Effexor.  I am on 5 mg, and am experiencing many of the symptoms I am reading about here - weight gain, feelings of emptiness, and craving for sweets.  The good part of it is all the depressing and worrisome voices are out of my head.  The bad thing is the emptiness, but I figure I should filling that void with good things - hobbies, music, more quality time with my beautiful wife.  Maybe that's the healing, not the pill.",7,"July 25, 2016",43
Abilify,Depression,I can leave my home and run errands without freaking out or sitting in the parking lot waiting for my husband or kids to drive me home.,10,"July 21, 2016",59
Abilify,Depression,"This is one dangerous drug as for me it made me feel half dead to me and the world around me it made my depression even worse and anxiety really bad to the point I was unable to do the things I wanted to enjoy. Was unable to settle..It put me in a dark place and gave me really bad dreams and good luck if on it more than 6months to come off, may the force be with you, it's a horrific experience so please keep clear!",1,"July 18, 2016",28
Abilify,Depression,"I was prescribed this medication after I  already tried lithium and seroquel. The lithium helped me a lot & the seroquel gave me bad headaches. So they put me on abilify. I could not sleep no matter what I took to help, I was restless , I threw up , my body temperature switched from hot to cold rapidly. I couldn't stand without being dizzy. It was the worst experience. My depression was better but my anxiety was insane. Definitely not worth the side effects",3,"June 30, 2016",28
Abilify,Depression,I have been on 20 mg of Abilify now for about 10 years. When I first began taking it I gained over 100 pounds in 6 months. I finally stopped gaining at 250. I have tried everything to take the weight off. Nothing. My doctor added 20 mg of Lexapro. I gained 30 more pounds. I am going to stop taking the Abilify as the weight gain is causing health issues. I just hope the weight will come off.,3,"June 18, 2016",39
Abilify,Depression,"Thank you for helping to relieve my anguish!  Depressed and low, my nurse offered this med and it is nice.  Of course, we are concerned about side effects, but I haven't had any serious issues with this one.  I am a White Female.  I am over 21.  How long is the recommended length of therapy with this med?  My nurse brings meds when he visited our home especially for me.  I am a busy home maker.  Basically, this is gentle yet effective.",6,"June 12, 2016",16

Abilify,Depression,I suffer from depression and anxiety and have taken every antidepressant medication you can possibly take. It wasn't until my doctor added abilify that I was able to function again.,10,"May 29, 2016",72
Abilify,Depression,"Started with 2mg in addition to mirtazipine, didn't notice much difference.  Now up to 5mg, for about a week, and still don't really notice any difference in my mood.  Everything is blah.  Life is blah.  This drug has really not done anything good or bad for me.",3,"May 27, 2016",25
Abilify,Depression,"I was on Abilify for about 6 months.as an add on booster to take with my Effexor   It helped somewhat  with my anxiety,  but not uresolved. Depression symptoms.  I felt like a zombie (which isn't always a bad  thing ) lol.  About 2 weeks after I stopped  taking it I developed a jerking movement in my arm,  but it went  away in a  few months.",5,"May 27, 2016",21
Abilify,Depression,Been on the drug for a few months now put on 2 stone and not happy about the weight at all as always have battled with my weight. Everyone says they have noticed the difference in me but think it's just the weight that's getting me down.,1,"May 12, 2016",15
Abilify,Depression,"I have suffered depression most of my life and finally was ""diagnosed"" by a psychopharmacologist in 2011.  I have been on pretty much every antidepressant known to man over the past 20 years and finally was put on a cocktail of Lithium, Prozac, Wellbutrin and Conazepam (at bedtime).  I had also taken Abilify at this time for about 1 year but the doctor felt I probably didn't need it anymore as I was stable.  However, for about the past 2 years I have been suffering from MAJOR fatigue and some days I was unable to go work as I was so tired.  My GP has just put me back on Abilify 5 mg and I feel fantastic.  I have so much energy and I have found happiness and enjoyment in the things I had lost interest in.",10,"April 30, 2016",90
Abilify,Depression,"I was told by my doctor that I might gain weight. He said that the signal in the brain that says, ""Thank you, I've had enough!"" which is what I always go by, and it keeps my weight steady, is DELAYED.  It's TRUE. he says portion control is the key. We shall see. I'm trying but I've already gained about three pounds and notice that I eat way more. I'll let you know if I get a handle on it. The drug is THE one added to my cocktail that made the difference.",8,"April 25, 2016",46
Abilify,Depression,"On 2 mg. It made me feel empty inside. Like things didn't bring excitement, adrenaline. Everything seemed blank. Had major sweet cravings for the first month or two but it leveled off. The most sweet cravings were at 5 mg a day. Really brought reality into full focus. Got it a pharmacy that use a different supplier that's cheaper.",5,"February 29, 2016",22
Abilify,Depression,"Our 12 year old son was having terrible anxiety and could not get along with anyone at school.  He did not trust anyone and would not listen to anyone either.  He suggested suicide more than once but thankfully never went through with it.  We regularly saw a therapist but would not listen. We reluctantly decided to add the smallest dose of abilify to his depression medicine. In approximately 2 days we saw an immediate change.  He seems more ""balanced"" and the anxiety level down significantly.  It has only been 2 weeks....but so far so good.",9,"February 27, 2016",97
Abilify,Depression,Night and day positive effect,10,"February 23, 2016",55
Abilify,Depression,"I started on this medication just 3 days ago at 2 mg. In conjunction with celexa  40 mg and 90 mg cymbalta. I have noticed some mild nausea but nothing else yet. To the 12 yr old girl, my doctor and pharmacy said this medication abilify should not be taken by anyone under 18 years.",5,"January 18, 2016",27
Abilify,Depression,I started this medication when I was about 11 or 12 and took it for 6 months. It made me so anxious and so restless I remember having to get up in the middle of class several times to get a drink of water to try and stop my anxiety. I had several episodes of this and always felt that I had to be moving. Maybe I was too young to be on the medicine though...,2,"January 16, 2016",25
Abilify,Depression,"I've been suffering with dibilitating depression, anxiety, and OCD for over 20 years. I've was in remission for 8 years, but this time it came back with a vengeance! I was really losing hope. I have tried every single antidep out there, and the ones that worked very well before, don't work anymore. I've been on a roller coaster and fighting for over 7 years to get my life back. It's been a living hell. I could hardly get out of bed, taking a shower was too much, even putting my seatbelt on seemed like a chore. If you have ever suffered, you know what I'm talking about! I was put on Abilify to help with my Effexor just three days ago and I already feel like I can conquer the world...I just pray it lasts! ",9,"January 10, 2016",174
Abilify,Depression,"This medication is amazing, but after 2 months I gained 20lbs. :/",10,"December 29, 2015",55
Abilify,Depression,"I was feeling like I was in a hole and couldn't get out  of it.  Nothing was working. I am now on lamictal and abilify and within a week I was feeling better. I take them both at night I don't know if that makes a difference,  but I always wake up early with lots of ENERGY and ready to do whatever. Which before all I could do was lay in bed. I hope I don't gain any weight, I haven't yet and haven't experienced any over eating and I'm on 10mg abilify and 200mg of lamictal. So they have both worked wonders for my depression.  With no side effects that I can see yet.",10,"December 13, 2015",112
Abilify,Depression,My lexapro stopped working so I was switched to prozac.  While prozac did help some it didn't help enough.  My psychiatrist prescribed abilify at 2mg to add on to 60mg of prozac.  Within 2 days I was pulled out of the dark hole I was in and  my crying spells were gone.  This pill is a miracle pill.,10,"November 9, 2015",114
Abilify,Depression,"My anxiety and then depression began about 4 months ago.  I didn't want to get out of bed, and had compulsive negative thoughts, no energy or motivation, and couldn't sleep, lost 20 pounds.  I was prescribed Lexapro generic.  This med did almost nothing for 3 months.  Within a week of adding Abilify generic, most symptoms changed.  I feel much better, have appetite, better energy, appetite, optimism, more like me, and motivated to get out of bed when I wake up...which is great.",9,"November 8, 2015",91
Abilify,Depression,Abilify does not work. It is not the medication for me. My heart races I can't breathe half of the time right  I get dizzy I'm panicky and unmotivated I'm Droggy and always lethargic very down and it has the opposite effect. !!!,2,"October 6, 2015",52
Abilify,Depression,"Taking this in conjunction with Wellbutrin and Buspar gave me my life back. 
My mood is stable, I'm happy, excited, and not over the top either. The trade name really describes this medication well that's for sure. However, this isn't for everyone. Also I must note the first 5 days kind of suck. I felt like my head was spinning and I felt nauseated like I was on a roller coaster all the time. Never threw up though. SO glad I stuck with it though. Well worth it in the end.",9,"September 1, 2015",81
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"This medication  Abilify almost killed me. I started it in January  for bipolar and felt flat and slightly suicidal (as I had before starting it) for about two months on it. Experienced some weight gain. After the two months, I began to have obsessive suicidal thoughts to the point I couldn't concentrate. Oddly enough, I didn't feel depressed just non-stop suicidal thoughts. I got off of it and switched to lithium, haven't had a suicidal thought in months!",1,"October 16, 2019",19
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"I tried to give Abilify a chance three times. I find no interest in activities, not suicidal but don’t feel inspired or a purpose to anything, I just want to be in bed all day and I easily get emotionally hurt or offended. I felt everyone would stare and judge me and so my Doctor kept saying that I would get better after a couple of weeks. The first few days I felt very high and happy, I also had high levels of energy but I couldn’t finish one thing before starting another. I also began to feel extreme panic, I had constant panic attacks, flushing sensation and once I began to lessen the dose to come off I experienced vertigo. I had not felt this before and I was in a panic thinking I had some tumor or had something haywire my nervous system and would never be the same. I stopped in July and it’s now October I still have vertigo but not as intense, I was just prescribed Wellbutrin and I’m really hoping it helps me. Everyone is different but this was my personal experience",3,"October 11, 2019",11
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"I took abilify for over 6 years and at first it worked very well. Year 2 I started having face twitching, shakiness and stuttering speech. 3rd year I started with tardive dyskinesia. 4-6 ish years I had all the aforementioned and added falling at least 6 times a day, I was so shaky I could barely walk, plus my memory was shot. I couldn't remember my  phone number or email address I had had for 10 years. New psych took me off and within 2 months almost all of the symptoms were gone. I think some of the shakiness and memory loss are permanent but I have a new lease on life. Poison. Pure poison. I wish I could have those 6 years back.",1,"October 4, 2019",23
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"Thank you all so much for your candid feedback!! I needed this for support and better understanding.
I sobbed reading every comment, because I can relate.  My 18 year old son has psychosis and mania.
Meds just changed.
Lithium dropped due to “out of range” high toxicity. 
Antipsychotic med. Risperidone, no longer affective after a year.
He has been on Abilify for 1 week.
After 1 day, I could tell his psychosis was disappearing. 
He realized date on the calendar, acted as if he had missed a month of his life. Then immediately jumped back in the game!
He showered with soap!
His obsessive, fixated thoughts and actions stopped, and he quickly 
reprioritized his responsibilities. 
Side affects- nausea, sick, no appetite for days.  (Zofran) is helping. 
Slightly more aggravated at times, pesters family, a little removed, impulsive and quick to snap.
It’s only been a week, so hoping these symptoms stop, and mood levels out.
Thank you again for sharing!
Love and wellness to all",7,"October 2, 2019",24
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,Worked well for 2 years but has been less effective lately.,6,"September 24, 2019",13
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"Wow. I took it and many of the reviews here could have been me. Was on it for 3 weeks couldn’t take the side effects. My tongue was  swollen 2x it’s size uncontrollable salivating. Anger outbursts that were uncharacteristic of me, impulsivity, akasthasia horrible kicking legs as I tried to go to sleep. Doc was kind enough to pull me off it as I gained 20 pounds in this month. Ridiculous. It was not a “live saver” for me either. ",1,"September 1, 2019",13
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"This drug destroyed my life. My sexual urges became insatiable and my drug use went supersonic. After the dust settled my marriage was destroyed,  I’m broke and my credit rating went 750 to 400. I’ve lost all credibility with my family and friends. I started going sideways almost immediately after I started taking Abilify. I had trembling hands   I cut myself and was very irritable.  I became a different person",1,"August 28, 2019",10
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"I've been on Abilify 5mg for 3 weeks now (taking for bipolar). I'm naturally a restless person so I like the feeling of having to do something all the time, It makes me feel like I'm contributing. Sleeping about 5-6 hours a night. Weight gain of about 2lbs. I feel better and a little more connected to my husband and kids as compared to when I was on Quetiapine.",7,"August 18, 2019",20
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"Well I've been on for 5 days. I'm a little more chill, but completely lost my ability to have an orgasm :( so...idk

Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"This medicine  Abilify has done wonders for my hallucinations ! They are 3/4 the way gone and I've never felt more stable in my whole life. Earlier when I was just depressed so they added Abilify to my Zoloft.  It did not spark joy at all, made me gain 15 pounds. But a year later I developed psychosis and they gave me Abilify once again. It worked like a miracle this time! I have been on this medication for about 6 months and its been so good, highly, highly recommend this if you are experiencing psychosis!",10,"August 7, 2019",25
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"I had commented approximately 2 weeks ago  (under the name:  I hate abilify. on the 2019-07-09) regarding the 400 mg abilify injection. Well I saw my new pdoc on the 18th and she is wonderful!!! I am no longer on the injection due to side effects.  In addition to all of the side effects noted previously, I forgot to mention the major weight gain also.  This drug is NOT WEIGHT NEUTRAL!!  IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR WEIGHT MOVE ON TO THE NEXT DRUG.  If you're not happy with your current pdoc find someone you are happy with.  Just because we have bipolar disorder or have a mental illness does not mean we can not control what we ingest into our body.  You have a choice!!! If you have a feeling of being trapped and your pdoc not listening to your concerns, MOVE on!!!! Good luck to all of you.....",1,"July 28, 2019",24
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,Helped with mania and depression. Stopped taking due to weight gain and erectile dysfunction.,4,"July 19, 2019",6
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder," I am on the 400 mg Abilify injection and I am miserable!  My pdoc is the worst.  She does not listen to anything I have to say about the drug regarding side effects.  I am having muscle spasms as I am typing right now.  I also have dry mouth, constipation, depression and agitation. I had this doctor with tunnel vision ten years ago you think I would have learned my lesson, but I do have an appointment on the 18th with a new proc thank god!!!!


God help us all!!!",1,"July 9, 2019",15
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"Abilify levels out my mania like nothing else but does nothing for my depression. Causes regular chest pain, weakness, and awful akathesia. Works for the most part, but I would definitely not recommend due to side effects.",4,"July 5, 2019",9
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"The most terrible drug I have ever been put on. Always tired, trouble moving and dizziness. Would not recommend this drug to anyone.",1,"June 25, 2019",12
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"A psychiatrist of very questionable competence added Abilify to my antidepressant so that I would have to come back more often for visits (my antidepressant was working fine).  The six weeks that I was on Abilify, I could not sit still in a chair for even five minutes.  All I would do is pace.  I have never been classified as bipolar by anyone but this doctor (major depression - yes) and I lived a nightmare while taking Abilify.  I don't wish this on anyone.  If a doctor suggests that you take this drug, please ask a lot of questions and do some research on your own.",1,"June 17, 2019",13
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"I was on this for over 3 years. To start with I thought it was working, the last year I had a racing head and high anxiety. Was discharged from psych so had to fight to get seen again to change medication. Realised a few months after coming off it that my finances had changed shortly after starting Abilify and not in a good way. I was never in debt before Abilify. I am 37 too. I’m in a lot of debt because of Abilify because I started taking out loans shortly after starting it amongst other things. Have since read that the FDA made the manufacturing company to list compulsive shopping, compulsive gambling and other excessive behaviours etc as a side effect in May 2016. I started it in August 2015 so was unaware when I researched this medication when I first went on it. No Dr made me aware of this side effect at any point. Please note I have been manic prior to this medication and had never taken out credit or borrowed money.",1,"May 21, 2019",13
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"I have a mood disorder and an anxiety disorder. I’ve been taking Zoloft for ~3 years, and although it helped with anxiety, it didn’t touch my intense mood swings. After a very bad mood swing that almost broke up my 7 year relationship, I sought help. My psychiatrist put me on Lamictal first, and it gave me hives. Then we tried trileptal, and the GI side effects were unbearable after 2 weeks. Finally she put me on Abilify and so far it has been great. I’ve been on 2 mg of Abilify (with 50 mg Zoloft) for a week and there have been almost no side effects. I was warned there might be dry mouth or excessive sweating but I’ve been fine. It did cause me to wake up 7-8 times during the night, but I switched to taking it in the morning and now I sleep like a baby again! It has only been a week but I’m starting to feel a difference: I have more energy and I feel more in control of my moods ",9,"May 14, 2019",19
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"Terrible experience. Started on 4 mg then the next day I couldn’t stop puking, had dangerously low blood pressure, and they couldn’t feel a pulse. I’m 19 and this is a relatively low dose to start on. I really think this medicine needs to be recalled because it is so dangerous. I would NOT recommend this drug",1,"May 9, 2019",14
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"Abilify works well for my bipolar, it really helped with my reaction to stimulus.",10,"May 6, 2019",16
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"Caused extreme hysterical sobbing  and suicidal-level depression after only 3 doses. I had to be hospitalized via ambulance, and spent an additional 2 days sobbing in my hospital room with the curtains closed. I’ve had bipolar II for 22 years, and this was, without a doubt, the most nightmarish emotional experience I have ever had.",1,"April 19, 2019",11
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"Of all the conditions this medication treats it seems that the lowest reviews come from people, like myself, who have bipolar disorder. I came to this site to read other reviews to see if what I’ve been feeling was somehow related to Abilify. I’m glad I read some of the reviews because now I don’t feel as crazy. 

My new psychiatrist was so confident that this medication would work that I’ve been convincing myself to ignore the things that were off but now it’s just unbearable. I am naturally very emotional and before this medication I absolutely hated it but now that I basically feel emotionless I want off of this medication. 

I’m envious of how this has been a miracle drug for a lot of people but for me it’s been fogginess, no appetite and just a general feeling “blah”. I also stumble over my words a lot and my creativity feels stifled by it. I’m calling my psychiatrist tomorrow and getting off of this stuff.",1,"April 15, 2019",9
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,I took this for three months and it caused me to gain 40+ pounds,1,"December 11, 2018",17
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"I’ve tried every mood stabilizer, typical psychotic and atypical antipsychotic for my Aspergers and Bipolar depression, and Abilify always helps the most. 
I feel happy on it and it helps me with dysphoric mania consistently. 
It does cause weight gain, but I have been able to lose weight on it by cutting calories to 1500 a day and walking regularly. 
Plus, it has a generic version now, so it’s cheap!",8,"November 30, 2018",22
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"I was started on Abilify  as a mood stabilizer for Bipolar I manic episodes . I was afraid to take it at first (as I am with all meds), but I took 1/4 of the pill days 1-2. Felt no I’ll effects except tiredness. Took 1/2 pill for 2 weeks. Noticed immediately my mood levelled out. Still made me tired at night. Groggy in the morning but wore off as the day went on. Now, on a whole 5mg and so far it has been wonderful! I feel so much happier and levelled off with my moods. I feel normal. It’s fantastic! It still makes me tired when I first take it at night (so I can sleep finally), but the early morning grogginess is much better. Used to last all morning. Now lasts maybe an hour. Love it!!",10,"October 28, 2018",20
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"After five months in 11-12 year old male, no noticeable side effects and works very well at reducing mania. (7.5mg)",10,"April 13, 2015",12
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"I am 40. I was diagnosed bipolar 15 years ago. My mania manifests itself as aggression/rage. My rage has been a problem since I was young. My violent outbursts consisted of me punching myself, bashing my head against walls and other horrifically embarrassing and dangerous actions. I was extremely verbally abusive to anyone unfortunate enough to be near me during my rages. I have been on many meds throughout my life. Every benzo. Mellaril. Thorazine. Every SSRI. Depakote. Lithium. NOTHING curbed my rage. In fact - SSRI meds INTENSIFIED my rage. 10 years ago, my psychiatrist put me on 20mg of Abilify. Within 4 days - I felt like I could finally breathe. My rage literally disappeared. But I don't feel ""zombie-ish"" like with other meds.",9,"April 11, 2015",72
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,Love it!,8,"April 7, 2015",15
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"I have bipolar 1 and started this medication to help with breakthrough symptoms while on a mood stabilizer.  Within the first few hours I knew this wasn't the right medication for me.  I was so anxious inside, I felt as if my blood was crawling around beneath my skin. After two days of taking it I knew that if I stayed on it, I would be at risk of suicide to stop that horrible feeling.  Taking it made me stay awake for two days, fretting with anxiety.  I spoke to my doctor the first chance I got and she immediately took me off of it.  I'm on other medications now and very stable for years.",1,"March 30, 2015",22
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"I'm on Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal. In ten years this combination is the only one that has worked. While it took some tweaking it is well worth it. Two side effects, constipation and eye rolling.",9,"March 17, 2015",25
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"Abilify changed my life. There is hope. I was on Zoloft and Clonidine when I first started Abilify at the age of 15.. Zoloft for depression and Clondine to manage my complete rage. My moods were out of control. I was depressed and hopeless one second and then mean, irrational, and full of rage the next. My Dr. prescribed me 2mg of Abilify and from that point on I feel like I have been cured though I know I'm not.. Bi-polar disorder is a constant battle. I know Abilify works for me because I have tried to get off it and lost complete control over my emotions. Went back on it and I was golden again.  I am on 5mg 2x daily. I am now 21 and better than I have ever been in the past. Only side effect is I like to eat a lot.",10,"March 14, 2015",34
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"Day one: TERRIBLE!  Very tired, had to stay home from work
Day two: Getting better.  Very tired in morning but the day improved
Day three: Wonderful!  I am not sure what ""normal"" is, but if this is it, I am in heaven.  Awake, focused, appropriate amount of energy, easy going mood, less irritable and lower anxiety (could be the xanax on the last one).

I am just beginning the medication but typically meds have a quick affect on me and stick.  I have not noticed any unusual appetite increases but I am certainly going to keep an eye on it because I noticed a large percentage experiences weight gain.  As my fiance says- mental health is more important than gaining a few pounds anyway.",10,"March 12, 2015",46
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"Desperately trying to get back on Abilify, but insurance is awful. My suicidal thoughts are back. The Abilify balanced me out and I could sleep while on it. (It's almost 5am, and I haven't slept yet.)",10,"March 7, 2015",28
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"I am a 28 year old female diagnosed with Bipolar 1, Generalized Anxiety Disoder, Panic disorder and Agoraphobia. A little over a week of taking this medication in conjunction with Lamictal and a benzo (Xanax, Klonopin, or Valium depending upon doc's decision) I felt like a million bucks. I could leave the house. I had a normal sleep schedule. I had energy for the first time in a long time. It was a miracle for me. Stopped taking it and downward I went again. Restarting now and I couldn't be more excited. I will say it made me feel restless and that includes Restless Leg Syndrome types of feelings. But, I would rather be restless and functioning. You have to weigh the pros and cons --for me it is a PRO!",9,"January 15, 2015",76
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"Abilify worked pretty good for five years with Prozac.  But then I became morbidly obese, with elevated bad lipids and prediabetes.  Also, I was constantly in fear of tardive dyskinesia.  I no longer take it.",5,"November 19, 2014",25
Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,"I'm a 21 year old female and just diagnosed with Bipolar I. It's been a roller coaster ride especially after gaining 10 pounds in the hospital while taking risperidone and Depakote. I'm still on the Depakote, though I hope to discontinue it as soon as my psychiatrist allows, but I just switched to Abilify. I've got to say, so far I have no complaints. With risperidone I had no ""lid"" to my hunger. It was endless, and that was quite disappointing. There were many other side effects, but the weight gain has added to my self loathing. Though the painful heart dysrhythmias are a close second.

I went from being chilled out and quite okay on Seroquel and Effexor but wanted to try Abilify to combat weight gain. In the two weeks I've been on it I've swung from hypomanic to aggressive and downright selfish.

At first I was more irritable but that subsided substantially after a few days. It made me feel a lot more calmer and in control of my emotions without making me feel like I was suppressing them. This is the first pharmaceutical medicine I have tried to treat my condition and it definitely worked better than the natural remedies such as St John's Wort, same, and passion flower. It even helped more than meditation. I have just switched to Latuda because Abilify gave me chest pains. If the pain was anywhere else I would of definitely stayed on the medicine because it worked.

Anonymous,Zovirax (acyclovir),"For Photoaging of the Skin:			“I have almost a year since I am using Retin A and let me tell you that at the beginning its rough. When you just begin using it, start with 0.025%, and once in 3 days, after 2-3 weeks do it once in 2 days, and always watch your skin, how does it feel.  If it's ok, after about a month you can use it every night.  If you will peel like a snake  - YES, if it might feel like burning or sensitive  -YES. But don't give up, I promise it is worth it.  It's not going to pay off instantly, but in time you will see an improvement of your skin. Remember to use SPF on your face  everyday, because Retin-A peels off the first layer of your skin, and it's very delicate.  Put your moisturizer at night, after applying Retin A, and in the morning before SPF. After about 7 months I switched to 0.05. My skin is glowing. And everyone thinks I'm 21, but I'm 31.

Bupropion,Depression,"Hi,

I started taking one bupropion pill a day and kept that dose for a month instead of upping it to the 2 pills after 4 days. I did that because of reviews I had read where they suggested a slower more gradual increase of dose.

I didn’t have any side effects other than being more thirsty, which I do not see as a bad thing because I hydrate more.

I did notice pretty quickly that I got more productive. And, I wasn’t as tired throughout the day, which is really nice because I am normally exhausted day round. Now, I just realized that I am not fixating on things as I used to. Before if there was a problem or a concern I would just stress it and stress it and keep it going around in my head.

Many others may have found this drug helpful, so please take my rating as an example and consider your own circumstances with your psychiatrist to determine what’s best for you. 

After 4yrs of being on 150mg, then the past 2yrs being on 75mg, I recently cut my dosage down even further to 37.5mg after consulting with my psychiatrist. It has been 4 weeks now and I haven’t felt depressed once. Usually I would go a few hours in a day w/o being depressed, wondering when it would come back. 

I am both regretting being on this drug for so long while extremely thankful that I finally addressed my concerns. My point is, talk more often with your psychiatrist and do not wait years like I did to make a change. Also, explore therapy before drugs.",1,"October 4, 2020",7
Bupropion,Depression,"Wellbutrin (bupropion):			“I began Bupropion about a year ago. Took a while to kick in,  Waiting eight weeks for the hoped-for effect was like waiting eight months. I had tried another med and it left me with negative sexual side effects which is why the doctor suggested Bupropion. I've been taking low dose Viagra, honestly don't know if I need it . . . but Viagra works. I told my doctor that I'm okay, but don't seem to feel any drastic change from when I first began the med. She suggested upping to 300 mg extended release. After a week I began to feel better but, don't know if it is from the med or the high of knowing I made the attempt at trying to feel better. Wishful thinking is a good way to put it.

So here's my question: Since I was already taking Bupropion at 150 mg/day extended release should I expect the new dosage of 300 mg to take eight weeks to fully kick in? Has anyone had this experience?",9,"October 2, 2020",47

This medicine makes me a more generally happy person and gives me energy and motivation to complete task. After taking it for 3 months or more I now notice no negative side definitely worth a try.

After a week on BUPROPION,  I would sing on the way to work and was unable to take the smile off my face.  After about 6 months these feelings wore off, but I was still better than before.  My Psych upped the dosage to 300mg per day.  I take two 100mg pills at 9am and then one 100mg pill at 230pm. Overall, I'm happy.  It worked for me.  Only side effects are a little insomnia  twice per month and ringing in my ears 4 times per month, which lasts for hours each time.  The ringing is very low.

Cymbalta,Depression,I was on this medication over ten years ago. It took a month for the fog to lift once I had started it. But then I started to be paranoid reading about the cymbalta withdrawals on the internet. So I panicked went off it. I always start at the lowest dose possible and stay on it a month before increasing to the next to avoid being sick. And it’s the same thing when you want to get off these meds to avoid withdrawals. You go off as slow as possible. And I want to mention that these meds are metabolized by different enzymes in our body that we all have different levels of because of our DNA. So one person might need a lower dose of cymbalta than another because they metabolize it faster than others. The goal isn’t to get to the highest dose but the dose that works with your metabolism. Ten years later and I have Fibromyalgia  too now so my new doctor decided to put me on cymbalta. I started at 20mg today and will stay with that dose for at least a month before I see if I need to go up. Remember Go Slow!,9,"February 28, 2020",66
Cymbalta,Depression,I started taking Cymbalta 30mg 9 weeks ago under my primary doctor's recommendation. I had severe anxiety and insomnia and very serious depression. I slept all day and had no motivation and couldn't shake it off no matter what I did. I have tried Prozac 50mg for depression and expressed I didn't like that it made me eat all the time (which lead to 50lb weight gain) and no libido. So she recommended this. I feel very numb (but not high) as if I have no more conscience. I also have a slow reaction time to everything. People will speak to me and I don't realize until they repeat my name over 3 times. I also cannot sleep still even with all types of otc sleep medications. I take Cymbalta in the morning so it has no effect on my sleep.

It was until a few months ago when I demanded being evaluated for bipolar disorder, and after a few tests they put me on Lamictal (in combination with Wellbutrin, Prozac and Mirtazapine) the first titration weeks was hell, my mood was all over the place.

Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"I've had a few unpleasant side effects. I feel truly blessed with this medication. I had bipolar 2 and  other more common medications were not an option for my mood disorder. 
It keeps me so much more stable. I took a lot of drugs before and was suicidal. I was able to get off drugs and stopped my suicidal urges.
I had grown unfaithful with psychiatry.  I was sure that this medicine would not work like every other thing but it helped me so much. 
There are so many positive effects. Prevents suicidal urges, lessen depression, relaxes my body, helped me take lower doses of Xanax, helps anxiety, helps sleep, Happy sometimes
Cons - It effects my memory bad and I've lost a lot of hair. I'm a girl and my hair is really thinning out. :/",10,"February 18, 2017",44
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"Lamictal is a great medication. The titration takes quite a while, but it's worth it -- honestly. It isn't too effective at controlling the hypo or full blown mania -- as something like Geodon -- but it's a crown jewel for depression, especially treatment resistant depression. In terms of side effects there are few to none for most people. What I got was some mild dizziness and photosensitivity/blurred vision (a little irritating but nothing serious). In combo with Zoloft this was the ""power cocktail"" I was on for years.",9,"February 16, 2017",32

I overlooked it & continued taking the Lamictal. When my doctor increased it to 100 mg that is when I started having a bad reaction. That night I broke out in a bad rash on my chest, stomach & left arm (not my right arm). I also started having bad chest pains. I called my doctors office the next day & the nurse told me to stop taking the Lamictal & go to the hospital. I'm stubborn, so I refused to go. My chest pains had gone away & the rash was clearing up, so I wasn't as worried about it as I was the night before.

Feel very stable and seems like my interests are coming back. I've taken lamictal before for a couple years and don't remember why I got off. First time I took it I got a rash but it went away. This time have not experienced a rash. Taking 200mg morning 200mg night. Seems to be a perfect dose for me. So much easier with my business, wife, and kids.

I still have cysts, I was told it's an allergic reaction on my skin to the drug. Now, after 2 years not taking it the cysts are appearing still but not as fast or defacing as it was. I read on forums the condition could never cure, but I am seeing good progress on my skin. It was a nightmare, it even gave me cysts on my scrotum. The body is slowly expelling them, but very slowly.

I did go manic on it a couple times when the medication dosage was increased and had to go on a second medication (Neurontin) to %u201Cbring me down.%u201D But the two meds together work to even me out.

I understood my illness is genetic Bc my uncle had it and my dad has it but don't accept it I guess. Anyway 70% of cases have a genetic background so feel better about that. You didn't chose this. I feel Lamictal is not working as well after two years but not a major change. I will increase it from 200mg to 250 this week. I control my depression with clonazepan. I feel anxiety makes depression worse. So when it kicks in then I feel stronger enough to make a prayer and it goes away.we need to do some work in our brain.

Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"Not the most effective. It did tone down my hypomania a little bit. I normally get depressive episodes at a set time every year, and lamotrigine pushed it a bit later than it would have been. Besides that, it didn't do much; I'm still having severe depressive episodes that lead to suicidality. No side effects on its own, but I've noticed that it seems to magnify the side effects of other drugs if I take both (e.g., if I take a drug that makes me drowsy, lamotrigine makes me more drowsy; if I take a drug that makes me nauseous, lamotrigine makes me more nauseous, etc.). All in all I'm pretty neutral on this drug. It's not great, but not bad.",5,"January 9, 2017",16
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"I am a 31 year old female. I was prescribed Lamictal by my psychiatrist after describing my terrible mood swings. I was easily annoyed, agitated, and irritable.

I feel much more ""normal."" I'm currently taking 50 mg twice a day. After about a month, I do notice my symptoms start to return. I tell my psychiatrist, and he ups my dose. I'm hoping I'll eventually reach a dosage that'll stick. I still have some anxiety (especially social anxiety), but this medication has helped me so much.

I have some mood swings and have had some impulsive behavior that I am not proud of. I was always very ashamed of this and was lucky that I could contain it by really white-knuckling through life. I eventually was exhausted by this and tried this medicine at the suggestion of a wonderful psychiatrist, who I am willing to recommend. Within a month I was a different person.

However, after some contemplation, and knowing that the lithium I was taking was not helping my bi-polar depression, and knowing Lamictal helps increase energy, I decided to take it anyway... I LOVE THIS STUFF. Its helped me so much, I've gone off lithium and am taking it exclusively for BP2. I'm on a low dose of 50 mg because I experienced some itching at first, which did go away after about a month. Now, I have NO side effects, and my depression is GONE without me feeling numb.

Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,I have been on 400 mg of lamictal for 12 years. My life went from a nightmare of being diagnosed with major clinical depression and anxiety disorder with racing thoughts to a normal life. I tried more antidepressants and combinations than I can count in the 3 years leading up to my rapid cycling bp2 diagnosis. I have minor hypomanic episodes a few times a year and only a few depressive episodes in the last 12 years. No side effects. Tonight I start Teva manufacturer generic.

Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,My experience with lamictal is different for me in most cases. I used to take 25mg of lamictal. When I had taken the meds everyday I didn't feel any different from when I wasn't taking them. I had no side effects it was like taking air. So I kept having suicidal thoughts & being angry at 8am & by 8:30 am i was happy. I just had different moods every 30 mins. So i talked to my doctor and told her the meds werent working i told her how i was feeling so she gave me 100mg. Ever since then i have had no feeling what so ever. Like I can choose what to care about & what not to care about. I'll be fine all day and by 8-9 o'clock pm all of my bipolar & depression hits me like a wave of sadness that I feel like I'm drowning in. I guess its worth it..,7,"November 24, 2016",25
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"Following about 4 months of being in a depressed state for little to no apparent reason (things were going good in my life), I added Lamictal to what I was taking.  Along with Lithium, I took Lamictal for Bipolar.  Lamictal worked very effectively to remove depression in a week.  The issue was that I got out of depression so quickly, that I actually entered into a moderate manic episode.  The episode did not lead to hospitalization, but had many of the elements that manic episodes have involving spending and lack of sleep and grandious thoughts and behavior.  I didn't experience any negative side effects with the drug, and I just think for me the drug jolted me too much.  No rash or anything, just scared me since I entered the manic.",8,"May 15, 2016",47

She suggested an off-label use of Lamotrigene. Within a couple of weeks I felt so much better! We scaled  back (and eliminated) Effexor SSRI. I continued to get better. She moved away, so I had to find another psychiatrist - or psych nurse. The new psych nurse did an interview, and said I was being treated for the wrong disease.

My mood has never been this stable from as far as I can remember. It took a few months to work though, and dosage is really critical. Going from 100mg to 200mg made a BIG difference. I also started taking more at night which helps keeps my irritability down in the morning.

I tried Lamictal as a last-ditch effort, but was apprehensive due to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome issue but that didn't happen to me.  I'm now on 350mg of the drug since then and although I can say it has treated my depression, it has not worked all that well for controlling bipolar symptoms, mainly the buying sprees and bad on the spot decision making (thinking nothing can harm me).  I have been seeing commercials on tv for Latuda and so I might ask my doctor about that.  Also there are some other side effects of the Lamictal that aren't pleasant ...",8,"April 12, 2016",23
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, bipolar with depression, bipolar without mania... The main thing I noticed about Lamictal is that it seemed to have helped with ADHD symptoms, that I really didn't know I had, until I read the symptoms for that. I was chronically late, my whole adult life. I lost almost every job I had due to lateness. I had other ADHD symptoms, but that was not my diagnosis. Guess I thought all those things were just character flaws. 
After I started taking Lamictal, I was not late anymore! It seemed to have helped with depression, but any benefit from that has seemed to come back. I came to this site looking for extended, long range use of Lamictal.",8,"April 7, 2016",43

It basically ruined my high school education, making it almost impossible to wake up and stay awake in the mornings because it was physically painful to endure. Lamictal changed all of that and turned my life around. I have now been on lamictal for 4 years. I have experienced no negative side effects. I am now in college with a 3.5 GPA. My mood is now more controllable, but it doesn't drug me to the point where I am a zombie or a different person. I feel like I can still be extremely euphoric, which is something I don't want to give up. I do sometimes still feel very angry or depressed, but I am able to manage and contain it better than I used to. I highly recommend this to those with bipolar",10,"March 26, 2016",90

So at 15 i stopped taking anything over the counter and self medicated for years I am now comfortable with the idea I may be on something for the rest of my life  and i feel this stuff is actually working for me. It may be because I'm older My brain( for the most part) has developed where its gonna stay.. Hormones are different etc. My only concern is how quickly your body adjusts to it and you have to keep increasing dosage.

On several occasions tried to take my own life. The last time I nearly succeeded, was on a 72 hour hold. The Dr. proscribed Lamictal at a low dose of 25mg. Gradually increased in increments of 25mg. I'm now taking 150mg. at bedtime and I no longer have thoughts of suicide, hopelessness or despair. I've been taking Lamictal for 2yrs. now, and I can honestly say that I enjoy life for the first time. Don't give up on this medication as it takes time to work. For me, it was about 2 months. I didn't have any side effects, but everyone is different. Good luck and God Bless!",10,"March 2, 2016",110
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"Did not help, Was on it for several months. If anything, it made my irritability worse and my temper shorter.",1,"March 2, 2016",31
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"Lamictal gave me two ulcers, failed a drug screen for one of the best jobs around (said I had PCP in my system), debilitating headaches and gained an immense amount of weight. I was hospitalized for attempted suicide and my doc got mad when I weaned myself off. Having said that, I know lots of people that has had great success with it. I guess it all depends on the individual. Not all bipolar cases are the same.",6,"February 23, 2016",24
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"I was very tearful when my doctor prescribed Lamictal because I had only been on SSRI medications in the past (they really messed me up and I was hospitalized). My doctor prescribed me Lamicatal at 25mg for 2 weeks, then 50mg for another 2 weeks, with maintenance at 100mg after that. I was tearful because I was terrified to relive what had happened before. Much to my surprise, Lamictal is what I consider my 'life saver'. I feel my moods have been maintained and balanced since beginning this medication. I have not experienced any weight gain at all only headaches from time to time. My libido has actually increased and I read that this medication can affect the menstrual cycle (which it has for me. has made them lighter!). I love Lamictal !",10,"February 22, 2016",72
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"Hello! I have not been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but I am 18 and have felt overly sensitive and quick to extreme emotions all my life. I have a trauma history, and have been prescribed Zoloft, Prozac, and Trazadone to cope with my rape trauma, ptsd, etc.. While these meds have helped a bit, My mood swings and my emotional scale still really effects my relationships and lifestyle. I've been feeling really hopeless and self hating lately because of the way I am and have always been. I am being prescribed Lamotrigine by my Psychiatrist and Doctor. I am a little scared at how it will effect me. I hate feeling numb and non-present. I want emotions I just want to control them and not for them to control me. I want to feel whole someday.",8,"February 19, 2016",44
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"In my opinion, Lamictal is a great medication. It helped with my moodswings & I didn't experience any side effects from it.

Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"I've take so many medications throughout the years. There was always something I didn't like. I always felt off with every medication.

Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,I have Bi Polar Disorder and had so far tried 4 or 5 combinations of mood stabilisers without success. Started on Lamotragine on a small dose and increased up to 100mg twice a day and felt good for a month. Fell then into a low and increased to 150mg twice a day and this has really helped. I recommend these to anyone who suffers with Bi Polar lows often,8,"January 22, 2016",43
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"I've been bipolar for 20 years. I'm a scientist, when I'm working. Lithium has always been helpful but is not so great for depression though it does help if you take it a while. I finally started lamotrigine about a month ago. Lots of friends and professionals I know and trust said I should. I was skeptical since drugs tend to be bad news. After just a month (I titrated up quickly, so I've been on 100 for 2 weeks. probably best not do that there's a fatal skin disease you can get) my low level depression feels better. 

I'd say it's genuinely beneficial for bipolar depression. A little dizziness but not so bad, and it fades. My friends say there's no evidence that more than 100mg or 150 helps, but it could increase side effects. 100 is good",10,"January 19, 2016",58
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"I have always been moody. Sometimes more than other times.

Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"I have several people in my family who has bipolar disorder but did not like the fact that my depression and manic symptoms were results of this. While I was in the military they tried numerous medications, from clonazepam and celexa, to trazodone and effexor. Finally one of my Doctors decided to try me on lamotrigine and see how it works. I must tell you quite honestly that this is one of the best medications I have ever tried to combat my bipolar disorder. During the entire time I was being treated for this I had to deal with an injury I had during the war. The military's option was to dope me up to my eyeballs with opiates, which unsurprisingly made my mood unbelievably euphoric constantly.",10,"January 2, 2016",57
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,Lamictal has singularly saved my life. I have BP 2 with rapid cycling with my dominant problem as depression. I would have hypo episodes but fewer than depressive episodes. First week on Lamictal I had a bit of a dull headache but that is it. Within a week the heaviness of depression was lifting. Now 10 years later I have zero headaches from it and zero side effects. Maybe I am a little less empathetic but I love this med. I have zero depression with maybe 1-2 brief episodes of depression per year. It never lasts and when one starts I may cry and feel really down but I feel it kick in and stop the endless spiral. I love this med.,10,"December 12, 2020",8

I do notice dry eyes and mouth but I'm not sure if it's the extra deep sleep or the medication but I feel stable today for once in a very long time.  I'm not fixated on racing ridiculous angry thoughts. I'm genuinely content and not overly talkative like usual. I've slowed down enough to enjoy moments. I'm only taking 25 mg per day right now.

Side effects initially just nausea & nystagmus when I increased the dose.  The nausea has now come back & I’m struggling to eat enough. I eat regularly until I feel sick but am loosing 2-3lb per month & I wasn’t big to begin with.

I’ve also been more distracted & it’s harder to remember things. I even get distracted when driving & have more extreme hyper days. But I’m also getting much more done so at the moment that feels great.  

My Dr says Lamotrigine is great for depression but not so good for the hyper end so suggests I either add in Ampriprazole or lower my dose, which I’m trying first.

It turned out the lamictal was causing problems with my biotin/vitamin b intake. After talking to my psych and stopping lamictal and taking biotin supplements, I could finally pass stool easily and slowly my hair grew back... though I sort of missed my leg and underarm hair not growing.

I weaned myself off because it was too distressing for me and all this started to worsen my social anxiety.

Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,"Lamictal has completely changed my life. I take it in conjunction with a low dose of abilify, and the combination has kept me from having manic/depressive for about a year straight now, something I never thought possible. At first I was just on abilify— a pretty high dose— and while it kept me free from hypomania, it didn’t really do much for the depression. Lamictal, on the other hand, has worked wonders in that respect. Very little side effects— I wake up nauseous but it fades after about an hour, and it’s definitely worth it. Other than that, no weight gain, and I believe it may have actually increased my previously nonexistent sex drive. The best part of lamictal is that I don’t feel flat or subdued. I’m still having the normal ups and downs of life, but for the first time, I feel pretty confident that they’re not bipolar related. It’s really been a miracle drug for me.",10,"March 10, 2020",116

I was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder and has found this to help with some symptoms as well. Unfortunately it does not help me reduce feelings of mania.

She said it could take weeks, but it literally took about 5 days to notice a difference. My racing thoughts and deep depression are getting better daily. It's such a relief. I finally have some hope.

I had to do a quick detox off of the lithium because of the birth defects associated with lithium and pregnancy. It was a horrible few weeks coming off of it (I did a quick 2 weeks taper) and the few weeks after that were bad. My new dr put me on a low dose of lamictal in combination with buspar for my anxiety. I started on 25mg of lamictal and 10mg of buspar,I started feeling better in about 2-3 weeks.

I take it in conjunction with a low dose of abilify, and the combination has kept me from having manic/depressive for about a year straight now, something I never thought possible. At first I was just on abilify— a pretty high dose— and while it kept me free from hypomania, it didn’t really do much for the depression. Lamictal, on the other hand, has worked wonders in that respect. Very little side effects— I wake up nauseous but it fades after about an hour, and it’s definitely worth it. Other than that, no weight gain, and I believe it may have actually increased my previously nonexistent sex drive. The best part of lamictal is that I don’t feel flat or subdued. I’m still having the normal ups and downs of life, but for the first time, I feel pretty confident that they’re not bipolar related. It’s really been a miracle drug for me.",10,"March 10, 2020",116

I feel so much better. I actually smile and laugh. I feel more engaged, focused, have more desire to be active and around people and I have not had suicidal ideation or feelings since the med kicked in. It did take several weeks for the med to begin to start working. For me it has been over a month before noticeable changes took effect. I hope it continues to work this well.

I was started on lamotrigine 25mg & was gradually increasing. 1 week into being on 50mg, I developed a rash in the back of the roof of my mouth and a very sore throat. After freaking out, I found out this could have been from Lamictal? I stopped the Lamictal and within 2 days my throat was totally cleared up, however still a bit sore. 
Thoroughout my time on Lamictal, I have felt increasingly worse. My body hurts and is tired, I feel flat and emotionless, and am in a weird and constant state of pain. I get exhausted just taking a shower.

Lamotrigine,Borderline Personality Disorder,"Hi all. Hope everyone before and after me here will eventually get better.
I have severe BPD with predominant depressive/ suicidal episodes and anger.
I'm also very anxious and anxiety gives me depersonalization episodes. 
So I was prescribed with lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer and it supposed to help with derealization episodes somehow.
At first it seemed to work, depression was not that deep and derealization seemed to be gone like as I was a kid again. But eventually after three weeks I've noticed that it all got much worse depressive/ aggressive wise. I also started getting chills and shivering with headaches. 
Last thing I wanted to add - don't mix it with anything like weed or alcohol.
My MD said I may smoke, but when I did I had severe panic attacks and something that felt like psychosis.
To be clear , I smoke occasionally for 5 years already and I've never got such feelings from weed.",3,"October 27, 2020",5
Lamotrigine,Borderline Personality Disorder,"I didn't think I would ever be functioning, or have a day without extreme ""agony"", anger, outbursts, and ideation. However, the DAY of taking Lamotrigine my emotions just calmed down. My life has improved exponentially. I feel like I can have a family, a career, a stable relationship, and haven't been ""on the edge"". I know studies say it doesn't work for us. I disagree because this is my miracle drug. Other meds didn't work for me, so my psych recommended lamotrigine. If you feel like you're watching a monster take over your life and you're just there for the ride: I recommend this. If you feel like your emotions take control of your body: I recommend this.
Negatives: Numb for the first week. Felt like I didn't love anyone? That's gone now.
Oil production: Worst acne of my life. That's ok. 
Dose changes: I'm on 150mg, and expect to go up. I know when it's time to increase because I'll have a breakdown. I'm worried it won't work once I'm on the max dose.

I was on it two weeks in total. I wish it had worked for me. So many success stories. Don’t be deterred we are all different. Diazepam is only thing that works for me & doctors will not prescribe !

I got Wellbutrin XL 150mg, which helped but made me super angry, my doctor then added in Lamictal 100mg (starting from the lowest dose and gradually increasing) and it cancelled out the anger they Wellbutrin caused and the two work phenomenally well  for me. Like a lot of people on here they say they felt the effects immediately, I can vouch for that. It put my brain into a zen state and I got my laid back nature back. Mind you this only worked for me along with seeing a therapist and working out constantly. Medication helps set the bar, but you gotta do the work to get to where you want to be.

Lamotrigine,Borderline Personality Disorder,"Lamotrigine sounded like a great drug at first, it doesn't affect your sexual health, it doesn't make you emotionally numb, and I imagine it helps a lot of people. PLEASE DON'T LET THIS SCARE YOU But unfortunately, for me, according to my doctor it had a very bad reaction once I moved up to 100mg that unfortunately landed me in hospital and rendered me unable to function properly for the next two weeks. It was due to my genetic profile and medication sensitivity that caused my body to reject the drug, If you are sensitive to higher doses to medication generally or get extreme anxiety with your borderline I highly recommend getting pharmacogenomic testing or a genetic profile for the medication (in Australia it is not that expensive) before taking this medication. What happened to me was rare but can happen, and I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through But in saying this please don't be scared to try this medication, because it has worked wonders for so many people.",2,"August 7, 2020",10
Lamotrigine,Borderline Personality Disorder,"Ok so when I first started taking this medication Lamotrigine for borderline personality disorder I felt really dizzy, slightly sedated, and had nausea. I read a lot of others people reviews saying if you can push past this initial stage your body will adjust to it, and what do you know  it took about six days to get over the initial side effects from lamotrigine. I feel WAY more balanced out, I am not over thinking, and the things that used to worry me or give me anxiety no longer do. I don't hold on to the negative obsessive thoughts like i used to. If something upsets me I am able to take a step back and look at the whole picture without blowing up. I realize it takes 6 weeks to reach full potential but oh my wow must I say I see and feel a difference within myself. I am going to keep taking this medication, as I can see its potential to change my life, the way I feel about myself, the way I feel and interact with others, and my whole outlook on things in general.

I hate to use the word ""miracle drug,"" but what this drug has done for me in the 5 weeks I have been on it is outstanding. After the first 25mg dose expired I began taking 50mg and it was almost like a switch was turned on in my head. I am up at a good time and became productive, which is a good change from sitting in bed for 16 hours replaying terrible scenarios over and over in my head. I've began dieting and exercising and my thoughts of impending doom and mood disorder symptoms have been much less than normal.

I did a lot of damage to relationships & my health. I have been put back on Lamictal 200mg again and  in 6 weeks I’m at peace & rational. I have no side effects except decreased libido. That is a blessing right now cuz multiple sexual partners was a struggle while off meds. I’m going to go back on Zoloft because I need more antidepressant than what Lamictal offers.

I knew he (admittedly, even) had some issues, don't we all?, and I think he wanted to stay in the more socially acceptable area of depression/anxiety and yes even drug use/abuse, so he never mentioned BPD and it was one of the diagnosis I wasn't really up to pace with until tonight..

This medication literally saved my life. If you do go on this medication, I must warn you that the change is very dramatic and adjusting to “normal” is very foreign and scary for a while - especially if you have been “this way” for a long time. Therapy is an absolute must. Talking through your problems, past and present, learning new coping skills and just having that support will help tremendously.

Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorder,"I am a 50 year old man in Texas.  Grew up around chemical dependency. I have severe abandonment issues. I live in fear. Well, of course no one means or keeps their vows anyway, she cheated 100 times it seems. Because of my depression I let her come and go. This is when my addiction to norco 10mgs took off to 60 a day.  I divorced. I got clean and I met and married the woman of my prayers. Turns out she was bi-polar. Reintroduce my addiction of norco 10 mgs 60-80 every single day. I got her help. She was put on  lamotragine and her issues all but disappeared. I started my sobriety and lamotragine at the same time. It helped me with my fear of abandonment and crying. Pretty boring review right. Lamotragine ruined my wonderful marriage to the woman I prayed for about 3-4 years for God to bring me because it ruined ALL SEXUAL DESIRE AND FUNCTION.

Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorder,"I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder in September. I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ptsd in the past, but always refused medications. I started Lamictal in September, it’s now February and I’m on 150mg. I never saw a difference in it working, still crazy mood swings, still very angry and uncontrollable moods. Still insane long lasting depressive episodes. I have lost 15 pounds and can’t gain it back due to sleeping 12+ hours during the day and not eating. Will be stopping this medicine and requesting something else. Everything is still 100% unbearable. I get nauseous here and there from this,  and the withdrawal symptoms are intense as well. I recommend this to anyone who’s condition is not extreme, and just needs something to help a little.

I do start to go a little hyper when upping my dose but am trying to find a good damper for that (quetiapine was a great combo til I had to quit for GI reasons).  My moods have been a little swingy from time to time and now that I think about it I just crashed from a hypermanic period but it wasn’t a mixed episode and I’m not in a depressive spiral...at least not yet.

However, I did have incredible orgasms!!!   Back down to 300mg and I am experiencing a bit more depression but seem to be pretty level.

My psychiatrist put me on Lamotrigine which I was on for 2 weeks when I noticed, as well as my family a HUGE change for the better in me. I was more calm and could handle difficult situations without freaking out. Unfortunately, I was one that ended up with the rash they talk about - I thought I was in the clear because I had been on it for 7 weeks. It really was a God send, but the rash was too much to take.

Diagnosed with BiPolar 2 after refusing to admit the diagnosis for 14 years. I finally cracked and realised I couldn't carry on faking it any more, superwoman professional in the city couldn't take it any more (me) couldn't hide my pain. 
Move on  to 10 weeks later and lamotrigine has been an incredible success so far. I started at 25mg and now on 125mg at 10 weeks in. I feel like I am on my way to being a new fully functioning version of me. Hardly any side effects whatsoever. No zombie crazy feelings like on the numerous SRIs I have tried over the years. Just calm. Finally. Thank goodness.   First few weeks I felt cranky, agro, angst ridden. Probably partly because I was annoyed  that I had to accept I would be on drugs for life. Yet now I am forever thankful and I am not up to 200mg target dose yet. Please stick with and let this drug work its magic as you titrate slowly up. xxxgive it time.",10,"January 15, 2020",27
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorder,"I feel terrible for people who’ve experienced SJS (Stevens–Johnson syndrome). It’s very important that you have a GOOD psych who increases your dosage  slowly and monitor you for skin rashes to avoid serious complication. That said, 100 mg of lamictal combined with 200 mg of Zoloft (and Xanax or Remeron as needed, usually only a few times a week) SAVED my life. I have bipolar 2 and PTSD and didn’t know I could live so normally until I began this cocktail. It’s been more than three years and I am a different person. I’ll never be completely cured; I still have periods of anxiety and depression, especially when life gets stressful, but nothing compared to my moods before. I was at a point where I knew I wouldn’t have survived another depressive episode, but this medication gave me the ability to live. I was foggy for the first two weeks settling into my regimen, but no side effects other than occasional nausea for a short period after taking my doses. ",10,"January 15, 2020",11
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorder,"WARNING for those with dry skin, allergies, eczema, acne, and other similar conditions. This med will likely exacerbate these and increase your chance of developing SJS. My psychiatrist at the time had not informed me of this. 

Was given 50mg a day to stabilize low mood and brief 2-4 day episodes of disassociative depression. Over time, I developed mixed and irritable hypomanic states to which Lamotrigine had little to no effect. PDoc increased the dose to 75-ish and I got migraines, forgetfulness, and itchy bumps across my back, chest, and shoulders along with cystic acne. I'm in the process of switching to Trileptal. Topamax might be another option for folks experiencing headaches and looking for something more ""stupefying"" in the same family.

Lamo is largely prescribed for unipolar depression. Mania/hypo stabilization appears to be hit or miss with others. Titrate your dosage very slowly to decrease the chances of SJS and note Lamo can take up to 8 weeks to reap the full benefits!",6,"January 14, 2020",6

She said it could take weeks, but it literally took about 5 days to notice a difference. My racing thoughts and deep depression are getting better daily. It's such a relief. I finally have some hope.

I started at 2.5 mg & felt great & 5 mg even better. At 10 mg became a little aggressive. Then tried 12.5 mg and hopefully 25 mg but I can’t get past 12.5 mg without wanting to rip someone’s head off! I cut that in half to 6.25 mg (1/4 of tablet). I am hyper, it makes me sometimes feel like I’m on speed but my head is clear & I’m extremely active now. I added 5 mg of buspar twice a day to take the edge off & reduce anxiety. Appears to be holding but wonder if I’m the only one sensitive like this.  I was diagnosed major depressive disorder & anxiety in 1997.

Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorder,"I started taking lamictal at age 18 years old for bipolar and  I’m still on it at age 21. Lamictal reduces the frequency and intensity of manic and depressive episodes. I’ve experienced less side effects on lamictal than any other mood stabilizer- antipsychotic Ive taken. The risk for harmful rash STS is present but rare (I think it’s 3 in 1000 people). This risk is reduced by ramping up slowly. It took time to achieve a therapeutic dose. Lamictal is less effective when combined with hormonal birth control, so I take a higher dose.  I’ve experienced depressive and hypomanic episodes on lamictal, but they were efficiently managed by increasing the dose or adding an antidepressant. (I take Wellbutrin and buspar for my total  drug cocktail). I recommend this medication because it works without harmful side effects (like weight gain and brain fog).",10,"December 27, 2019",9

However, the intensity and frequency of these episodes have diminished greatly. Lamictal has really improved my life and I think I would be in a drastically worse position without taking it.

I was crying daily after months on it and could not feel any happiness or positive emotions although it was helping with outbursts for sure. 
That's when the physical side effects began. I developed severe painful cystic acne whereas before I had fairly clear skin.

I love this medication so much because life is 1000x more manageable and I never knew I could feel this way. I was so close to ending my life and this medication saved me along with learning DBT skills. However, it was really uncomfortable until I got stabilized on the 150mg.

Latuda,Bipolar Disorder,"Latuda created a significant improvement in managing my bipolar.
I was diagnosed with Bipolar in 2002.
I used to take Seroquel, Depakote, Lamictal and Buproprion.

Seroquel left me drowsy in the morning until 11am. I also used to stay awake until 2am and sleep only 5-6 hours a night, which damaged my ability to lead a happy life. It was leading an unbalanced life.

A new psychiatrist replaced Seroquel with Latuda, as well as removed Depakote and Buproprion.
Latuda is a lot less sedating than Seroquel. I take it before sleep and I am able to be productive in the morning.

I am taking 60 mg and continue Lamictal at 300mg at night. 
Results are excellent and so far, I have not experienced any side effects.
I see another comment here that taking it with 350 calories improves absorption by 2x or 3x.

Latuda,Bipolar Disorder,"I was prescribed latuda for borderline personality disorder and bipolar. I took it for about a year and it helped me stabilize my mood.

This caused my periods to stop, my breasts to swell to 3x it’s regular size, lactation, pain during sex and complete loss of sex drive. In addition high prolactin causes the body to store fat so I now suddenly have tons of cellulite in little under a year of taking it and it can cause acne which has given me hormonal cystic acne that has scarred my face.  Getting off the latuda caused my breasts to deflate and become misshapen and have stretch marks and I’m still waiting for my periods to return. Which may impact my fertility.

Maintaining sobriety became easier, my self-esteem grew larger, my social graces and ability to establish and maintain friendships grew, my interpersonal relationships with family and friends were enhanced and my emotional regulation was extremely tolerable and in comparison to before actually quite delightful. I no longer got extremely upset about things. I no longer blew up at people. I started to be able to think about things before I said them instead of just letting it all out and not only regulate myself emotionally but also socially. 

They started me at 20 mg I am still at 20 mg and I will probably stay at 20 mg for the rest of my life. I love it!!",10,"October 22, 2020",38
Latuda,Bipolar Disorder,"Latuda is probably the best antipsychotic I've tried. I'm a little sedated, but not too much... Which is good because I have a lot of anxiety normally, but its waaaay better now. 

My hypomania went away, but my motivation hasn't vanished..it definitely helps my depression too. It also took away my minor auditory hallucinations completely.

I like that I feel way more normal on this than any other antipsychotic I've tried. I'm not a zombie, I'm not hungry all of the time, I'm not anxious, I'm not depressed, and I'm sleeping normally (no insomnia or hypersomnia). I feel ok! 

The only downside is it causes some troubles focusing and some loss of motivation, but all antipsychotics do that to me and this one is minor compared the others. 

I've only been on it about a month, but so far I really like this medicine!",9,"October 21, 2020",15

I’m withdrawing from 250mg Lamictal, so uncertain what, if any, side effects are present. I take it at night, fall asleep hard, Then wake up early.

Latuda,Bipolar Disorder,"Took Latuda 3 years ago for Major Depressive and Anxiety Disorder for about half a year at 20mg, and it worked incredibly well, but I lost insurance. Side effects that I remember were mostly tremors. 

I was able to get a trial from a new doctor, this year, but he only had 120mg. I know it's seriously ill-advised, but he suggested I cut the pill into 6 pieces. I did that out of desperation, and even shaved them down to make sure it was less than 20mg. I've been doing this for about 3 months.

It helps, but the side effects can be bad. I feel discomfort during the day sometimes, that I can't really describe; I feel irritable, and scared when I'm going to sleep which is the worst of my side effects; Head tremors; I also gained some weight, but only a couple lbs at best.

Obviously my current experience is through manipulation of the pill, which you definitely should not do, but hopefully it helps someone weigh their thoughts.",5,"August 13, 2020",12

I was not sleeping well and felt empty, emotionless, like a zombie   After 7 months of this awfulness on 80 mg Latuda, I became manic and psychotic, developed extreme paranoia, was not sleeping  and tried to end my life.

I felt nauseous for two days, but day three was awesome! Then I realized I was not sleeping, so my doctor added trazodone. Even with the trazodone I could not sleep during the night, plus, the trazodone made me a zombie during the day! I quit the trazodone and changed the times of the Latuda to day and still couldn’t sleep! Last night I didn’t take anything and I finally slept  Today I’ve felt nauseous all day!

I don't have voices anymore. I don't feel scared to go to bed because I think someone is going to kill me. I finally think that I'm a real person. This medication is a literal lifesaver. I have taken many antipsychotics, seroquel, zyprexa, risperadal, and abilify, as well as half a dozen antidepressants since I was a little kid, nothing has worked.  I do not care though, as I finally can think clearly for the first time in my life.

I am now stable with Latuda 40mg and 10mg of Prozac. I feel myself again. I know have the energy to do anything, my anxiety is gone, I can sleep, and I genuinely feel happy. The side effects I felt at first was restlessness and feeling extremely tired and subtle headaches. Now, I usually get tired within 2 hours. I sometimes get panic attacks every 3 months or so.

Latuda,Bipolar Disorder,First major depression in 1980. Tried first psych med in 1991. Diagnosed bipolar. Taken over 30 meds for treatment resistant depression.  Put on 40mg latuda in psych ward this last September.  This med lifted a veil that had been obscuring who I was for decades.  Overly emotional sometimes. Aware of new feelings and emotions. Desire intimacy from wife often.  Have addressed a couple of serious character flaws I was oblivious to. Active and not in bed all day.  Working on dose with psychiatrist still. Using lamictal for moods and gabapentin for anxiety. Latuda addressed the treatment resistant depression.  I feel that once I clean up the wreckage of my past I can move on and begin a whole new life. I only have about 35 years left so I will make it count. Hard to believe that one little pill could do all of that.,10,"February 21, 2020",104

Terrific drug for Bipolar  depression!  But became non-effective.   Now 2019 and trying it again.  Been on it for 2 weeks.  Started at 20mg and doing dosing pack samples titrations up.  After 2 weeks I felt the huge difference.  Like a light switch clicked on!  First two weeks was exhausted and slept for 13 hrs a night!  After 2 weeks it went away!  Work 12 hr. Days and actually enough energy to run errands after work!  Phenomenal!!!  I even had energy to water my front yard last night!  Oh my gosh!!!! Titrated up to 40 now for 2 days!  Note, it can become non-effective just like any drug.  Trick is to hang in there.  This med can take up to one month to become effective the first time taking it!!!  Stay on it!  Do have aches in bones due to it but sleeping well and feel human!!!  Thanks Latuda!",10,"August 23, 2019",32

At my third month my doc and I increased my dose to 40mg. I was only on that dose for maybe 6 weeks, and was still feeling some depression leaking through, so we recently upped my dose to 60mg. I have noticed myself shaking my foot some and feeling anxious a little, but, I also could relate that to my annoying family members who are in town.

I did not want it to effect her. During pregnancy I didn't notice anything. My daughter was born at 37 weeks to preeclampsia  and her bili count was low. She is now 6 months old and beautiful. She does have colic and acid reflux. I do not know if that is due to the medication or just simply how she is.",9,"August 11, 2019",11

I took this medicine for almost a month before I realized it was causing me to have hives and also swelled my lip, foot and hand and it also caused my voice to change. I have been trying to figure out what I was allergic to thinking it was food allergies or detergent, etc. After reading others comments I now realize it's this horrible medicine. I called Walmart 4 days ago and told them about the hives/swelling and they immediately changed me back to my original medicine. The pharmacist told me it could take a week or longer before the swelling and hives are gone.",1,"November 16, 2020",15

I didn't question the change (I should have and researched). I've had three primary side effects which are sleeplessness, DAILY Headaches, AND Weight Gain (approximately 20lbs in 5 months). I actually was issued Levothyroxine today as my refill. I had asked to speak with the Pharmacist prior to noting the change back so apparently Walmart got the message. When I got home I decided to research and was somewhat relieved to read the other reviews. This is by far the worst medication I have ever taken.",1,"November 12, 2020",8

For a while I have felt awful. More headaches, tired, achey, moods drops, thirsty and have to pee more. Probably because I drink so much water at work. I am always hot ,especially at work. I have been thinking it was because of the mask I have to wear at work. We are not allowed to use indoor fans either, so I get overheated, sweaty, thirsty and headaches.

Within the last year, WalMart, who I've used since they started offering $4 maintenance drugs, refilled my levothyroxine with a carded medication dispensed in boxes of 30 - Euthyrox.
Four months ago, my yearly thyroid lab was slightly out of range - 0.1 on a scale of 0.3 to 5.6.  My dose was adjusted from 0.112 to 0.100. My labs went from 0.1 to 41.6 Labs this out of range are typically newly diagnosed patients who have not had their thyroid tested and/or were not on medication!

I was diagnosed with Bipolar in 2002.
I used to take Seroquel, Depakote, Lamictal and Buproprion.

Seroquel left me drowsy in the morning until 11am. I also used to stay awake until 2am and sleep only 5-6 hours a night, which damaged my ability to lead a happy life. It was leading an unbalanced life.

A new psychiatrist replaced Seroquel with Latuda, as well as removed Depakote and Buproprion.
Latuda is a lot less sedating than Seroquel. I take it before sleep and I am able to be productive in the morning.

I am taking 60 mg and continue Lamictal at 300mg at night. 
Results are excellent and so far, I have not experienced any side effects.
I see another comment here that taking it with 350 calories improves absorption by 2x or 3x.

This caused my periods to stop, my breasts to swell to 3x it’s regular size, lactation, pain during sex and complete loss of sex drive. In addition high prolactin causes the body to store fat so I now suddenly have tons of cellulite in little under a year of taking it and it can cause acne which has given me hormonal cystic acne that has scarred my face.  Getting off the latuda caused my breasts to deflate and become misshapen and have stretch marks and I’m still waiting for my periods to return. Which may impact my fertility.

I no longer got extremely upset about things. I no longer blew up at people. I started to be able to think about things before I said them instead of just letting it all out and not only regulate myself emotionally but also socially.

I like that I feel way more normal on this than any other antipsychotic I've tried. I'm not a zombie, I'm not hungry all of the time, I'm not anxious, I'm not depressed, and I'm sleeping normally (no insomnia or hypersomnia). I feel ok!

My Dr. took me off of it 3 days ago and besides sweating and jitters I'm back to 'normal'.

Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorder,"Latuda (lurasidone):			“Took Latuda 3 years ago for Major Depressive and Anxiety Disorder for about half a year at 20mg, and it worked incredibly well, but I lost insurance. Side effects that I remember were mostly tremors. 

I was able to get a trial from a new doctor, this year, but he only had 120mg. I know it's seriously ill-advised, but he suggested I cut the pill into 6 pieces. I did that out of desperation, and even shaved them down to make sure it was less than 20mg. I've been doing this for about 3 months.

It helps, but the side effects can be bad. I feel discomfort during the day sometimes, that I can't really describe; I feel irritable, and scared when I'm going to sleep which is the worst of my side effects; Head tremors; I also gained some weight, but only a couple lbs at best.

Obviously my current experience is through manipulation of the pill, which you definitely should not do, but hopefully it helps someone weigh their thoughts.",5,"August 13, 2020",12

Started at 20mg and doing dosing pack samples titrations up.  After 2 weeks I felt the huge difference.  Like a light switch clicked on!  First two weeks was exhausted and slept for 13 hrs a night!  After 2 weeks it went away!  Work 12 hr. Days and actually enough energy to run errands after work!  Phenomenal!!!  I even had energy to water my front yard last night!  Oh my gosh!!!! Titrated up to 40 now for 2 days!  Note, it can become non-effective just like any drug.  Trick is to hang in there.

I have noticed myself shaking my foot some and feeling anxious a little, but, I also could relate that to my annoying family members who are in town.

I did not want it to effect her. During pregnancy I didn't notice anything. My daughter was born at 37 weeks to preeclampsia  and her bili count was low. She is now 6 months old and beautiful.

After that, my doctor took me off it,I still continued vomiting for another week. I had to go on a soft diet and still had stomach pain.

I underwent an endoscopy, and several small ulcers and erosion was found in my stomach.

I was noticing my anxiety was through the roof and I was constantly obsessing about things happening that were far from reality.  This went on for a couple of years, until I reevaluated that my life turned upside down months after I started taking this drug.  I had never been so far from reality and not present.  This drug literally took life from me and made me lose myself.  I am currently tapering off the drug and began something else and already feel these horrible effects tapering off.

I am currently 37 weeks pregnant and chose to get off of it at the beginning because it's a newer medicine. They've monitored me and I've done ok. Coming off of it wasn't too bad. They had me wean myself slowly. I did experience mild restless legs when I first got on it, but it passed. I took it at night because it made me sleep. I think everyone reacts to meds differently, but this one is it for me. My family even said it had been years since they had seen me happy and stable like that.

For akathisia either cogentin or propranolol will resolve it quickly and effectively with little side effects.  I have used Latuda for over 3 years now and there is no better, highly recommend this med as nothing else has worked even close to as well and most importantly for those complaining about weight gain they must watch what they eat or workout as I have LOST tons of weight since the switch from Geodon to Latuda years ago and have kept it off.",10,"August 18, 2018",26

After that, my doctor took me off it,I still continued vomiting for another week. I had to go on a soft diet and still had stomach pain.

I underwent an endoscopy, and several small ulcers and erosion was found in my stomach. My gastroenterologist believed that this may have been caused by the Latuda, as I did not have this problem before. To top it off, it's very expensive, even with insurance.

I debated going to the ER but I read online to try Benadryl. After 4hrs of panic and not being able to function, the Benadryl calmed me down. When the Dr called back, she told me to go back to 20mgs.

I was noticing my anxiety was through the roof and I was constantly obsessing about things happening that were far from reality.  This went on for a couple of years, until I reevaluated that my life turned upside down months after I started taking this drug.  I had never been so far from reality and not present.  This drug literally took life from me and made me lose myself.  I am currently tapering off the drug and began something else and already feel these horrible effects tapering off.

I am currently 37 weeks pregnant and chose to get off of it at the beginning because it's a newer medicine. They've monitored me and I've done ok. Coming off of it wasn't too bad. They had me wean myself slowly. I did experience mild restless legs when I first got on it, but it passed. I took it at night because it made me sleep. I think everyone reacts to meds differently, but this one is it for me. My family even said it had been years since they had seen me happy and stable like that.

For akathisia either cogentin or propranolol will resolve it quickly and effectively with little side effects.  I have used Latuda for over 3 years now and there is no better, highly recommend this med as nothing else has worked even close to as well and most importantly for those complaining about weight gain they must watch what they eat or workout as I have LOST tons of weight since the switch from Geodon to Latuda years ago and have kept it off.",10,"August 18, 2018",26

My whole world stopped how could I ever had a boyfriend or get married while piling on so much weight, eating and sleeping with no sex drive and leaking boobs Antipsych meds especially back then were horrendous in terms of side effects.

I started Latuda roughly 7 years ago, so at the age of about 31 and finally I have my sex drive back although I don't believe it will ever be the same, at least I am back in working order there, my boobs no longer leak, I've lost some weight, and I can feel again.

It was torture.

I will take the chance of relapsing in order to determine if I will remain normal without meds. In these three years I never had any symptoms and I don't think it would be intelligent to immediately assume it was because the meds had been working the whole time.

I was informed that the drug could cause side effects, such as extreme unrest when getting to sleep. After two months of use I started to feel horrible side effects. Feeling extremely vulnerable in social situations and anxiety. Often I experienced the worst nightmares through the nights while being/feeling fully awake. I had uncontrolled panic attacks and started to sweat heavily. Many unpleasant thoughts and even experiencing not being alone. Also physical abnormal behaviour in the face/mouth/tongue. This could last for many hours until I fell to sleep being totally exhausted. I never had such issues before. It happened mostly once a week. I always was afraid to go to sleep. For a long time I didn't suspect the drug being the trigger. But at the end I quit the drug for good, even so my doctor didn't recommend it.

The only problem I have is the anxiety, its a very intense nauseous anxiety that is worst about an hour or 2 after I take the latuda med with dinner. I thought I could deal with it but its gotten a bit worse? I feel it throughout the day now. I asked a doc yesterday for something to help with it and I got buspirone. It doesn't seem to help much. I'm really sad that I might have to find a new med as others I've tried have had worse side effects. I've tried zyprexa, risperidone and abilify.

HOWEVER, I started getting really bad anxiety. So bad I had to stop. Hopefully I can find a way with my doctor to manage the anxiety because everyone around me noticed I was a LOT easier to deal with.

After an extremely painful BM, one I almost couldn’t pass myself, I decided to try Miralax. I had already changed my diet, upped my fiber, drank excessive amounts of water. 3 days after taking this, and 3 days after my last very painful BM, I went. And it was soft, quick, and only a little painful (a 1 or 2 on a pain scale instead of a usual 8-10). I cried, from happiness. I didn’t think I could ever not be in extreme pain and fear.

One thing may work well for 1 person but not for the next. So just cause there’s a bad review of this product for 1 person doesn’t mean it’s bad for everyone.

I have found that I have to switch it up because whatever regimen I am using stops working after a while. I am here reading these comments because after using Miralax for about 2 months everyday. I started having urinary incontinence. I have a constant pressure in my bladder and I have to go to the restroom more often. Also when I need to go I can't hold it, it's very uncomfortable if I try. I was working for constipation, that's why I had been using it everyday.  I was already checked for infection, UTI, and other issues.

I tried every laxative and they just tore me up. The stomach cramps where awful and still very little bowel movement after straining for hours. Finally I told my Doctor I cant keep doing this. Its horrible and miserable. He said, Get ""MiraLax"". I was  skeptical, but agreed to try it. I have not been constipated since that day. I take 1 dose daily at the same time every day and have a full bowel movement everyday at the same time. The only side effect I have noticed from Miralax, is the stool has a horrible smell.

MiraLAX,Constipation,"Within hours of taking the recommended dose to help with post-op constipation, I basically got to relive the experience of a bowel prep all over again, but this time with violent gas pains, cramping, and bloating. I woke up at 1 AM and spent the rest of the night and following morning staggering back and forth from bed to the bathroom in agonizing pain. When the waves of cramping hit, I could barely stand or move. Excruciating! The worst part was, the consistency of my stools was so weird that I just kept having to go very little amounts at a time. It felt like the misery would never end. Especially after my poor insides had been scrambled around during surgery, this was one of the painful things that could happen. I even passed out for one hour in between all the madness and had a vivid nightmare that I was deceased and no one could help me. That is a pretty fitting summary of what taking one dose of Miralax felt like post-op. This stuff is pure awful",1,"November 19, 2019",32
MiraLAX,Constipation,"I have had IBS since I was about 7 years old, back then there was no such thing as IBS, Finally at age 15, I was told I have IBS, back then, I got severe constipation, then severe diarrhea with such bad cramping! Then at age 20, it just turned to just constipation, so from age of 20 till last year, I only went 2 times a week, I could not take anything due to the cramping, then found milk of Magnesia, which did work, but I had to get the right dose, usually the child dose. So about 8 months ago, I got so constipated! I always thought miralax was harsh, so since I had not gone in almost 2 weeks!! I would try anything! Took it for 2 days, then I did the best bowel movement I can remember! Now I take it about 1 time a week, with NO cramping! NO Diarrhea. From age 20 to my age now I had only had those round balls of stool, now when I go, it is sausage like - how it is suppose to be ! To be honest lol, I just can't believe how large long my stools are!

Effortless, painless, easy, quick bowel movements and relief within 24 hours. It's very effective. But taking it is a pain! Every time I take it, it tastes so bad (the flavorless one) no matter what drink I put it in that I have to drink it holding my breath with a straw over the sink in case I vomit and rinse my mouth out with soap afterwards. It's actually conditioned me to stop drinking some beverages because the taste reminds me of when I mixed it with miralax. I gag so badly after taking it. The nausea and burping from it usually lasts for 2 hours after I take it and I have trouble keeping it down and not vomiting from the taste.

During all this I was also diagnosed with spastic colon and anxiety issues. I have done the milk of magnesia, magnesium citrate liquid, and enemas all these years.

Bingo, at 6 am on the morning of day 6 things returned to normal--happy for her.  Thus far she has stayed regular with that single dosage on day 5.

MiraLAX,Constipation,I have always suffered with constipation. I cannot 'go' in a public place nor can I go with people around. This has been debilitating for me.  I do find that enemas work well when we get company that stays with us.  The problem is that once they leave it is hard to go without an enema.  Usually 3 cap fulls of Miralax and lots of water and a day later I start to go.  Then I'm usually regular without taking any more.

My doctor recommended Miralax, and the rest is history. I’ve never been regular, but as long as I drink enough water, I have no problem getting a bowel movement with this! That’s also something my doctor said.......STAY HYDRATED. Miralax is an osmotic type laxative and really only works if you are drinking enough liquids!! It takes one dose at night for me to have a movement around lunch the next day! If I haven’t been drinking a lot, then it usually takes 3-4 days of continual use for me to get a movement....and those are always loose. Otherwise, they are easy to pass and healthy quality.",9,"June 30, 2019",42

MiraLAX,Constipation,Although MiraLax works...it makes you have ice cream soft serve like bowel movements..the bad part for me is I will feel like I have gas and will just let it go and you shouldn't. Don't trust a fart - you will poop on yourself. For real. I just did. You also need baby wipes after bowel movements otherwise you will go through a whole roll of toilet paper trying to clean up your backside. I'm glad I've been able to have movement but I'm not ok with the side effects of it. I may just start taking something else to produce bowel movements. Maybe I'll try benefiber and see what that does. But it took about 2 days for me for it to work. I have to take excedrine pm for me to sleep and I think that's what causes my constant hard ball constipation.  So this helps but I can't be at work and poop on myself and or not have wipes to get fully clean. It seems to just cling to backside.,6,"June 14, 2019",84

Risperidone,Schizophrenia,"Risperdal (risperidone):			“I have used Risperdal several times over the last few years. Originally, I was taking it for ruminating thoughts (I call it busy head) and difficulty sleeping. It definitely helped slow down my thoughts and allowed me to sleep better.  After my son was born, I was having some postpartum depression and went back on Risperdal.  It helped with the kindling and agitation, but I did gain about 10-15 pounds on it.  When I stopped the medication, the weight fell off.  Most recently, I'm using it as an adjunct therapy to Neurontin and Trileptal for agitation and anxiety. I have emetephobia and this has been the only thing that has allowed me to be around my phobia and not have a panic attack and an ER visit.  I do not like the weight gain.",8,"December 7, 2012",23
Risperidone,Schizophrenia,"I was 21 years old when I took Risperdal. 3 months later I had weight gain and uncontrolled full body tremor. I was in hospital then.

Risperidone,Schizophrenia,"Risperdal (risperidone):			“I smoked a lot of marijuana as a young man. Me being a late bloomer, I think it affected my brain chemistry. One day I felt an explosion in my head, after that I started hearing voices and became really paranoid. I finally admitted that I needed help, after seeing that I coudn't hold a job, snapped at people, starting fights with people for no reason, insane thoughts and a brain I couldn't control, I was prescribed Risperdal for schizophrenia, Ativan for anxiety, and benzotropine for side affects, all these medications for what my kind doctor called a brain disorder. Stopped paranoid thoughts, delusions, gained social skills back. No libido, 15 lbs weight gain in month, But feel sane again. Seems to work for 7 hours, then paranoid again.",9,"January 21, 2012",81
Risperidone,Schizophrenia,"Risperdal (risperidone):			“My son had severe acute psychosis and possible diagnosis of schizophrenia at age 17.  Risperdal (Risperidone) brought him back to his normal self, for the most part.  He has put on weight (2 trouser sizes bigger) and he is inclined to rock back and forth a little, when seated.  He is slightly less motivated and says he doesn't retain information as he used to at school.  This may be improved by adjusting the dose.  But this medicine gave me my son back and seems well-tolerated by him.  The psychosis is completely gone.",9,"September 14, 2011",68

Now he decides he doesn't need it anymore. Well the voices are totally out of control. He can't even hear me when I talk to him, because the voices are so loud. He doesn't sleep, he talks constantly to them. I just wish he would take the medicines.

Risperidone,Schizophrenia,"Risperdal (risperidone):			“I used to hear voices on a daily basis, especially when I was near a fan or running water, the noise turned into words.  Since I have been on Risperdal I have had a significant decrease in the voices to where they are almost gone.  If I don't get any sleep or I am really stressed out the voices come back, so I try to get plenty of sleep and avoid stressful situations.  I give Risperdal an A .  The first week on Risperdal I was extremely sleepy.  It was really hard to wake up, but now I am fine and my body has adapted to the medication.  You should try it.  The peace of mind I get from Risperdal is priceless.  I used to think my thoughts were being broadcast out loud and now my own thoughts are much quieter.",10,"June 16, 2009",131

Saphris,Schizophrenia,"My  first 4 days of 5mg am  and 5mg pm was horrible. OK I have IBS and have problems frequently. As soon as I started saphris I develop severe diarrhea with vomiting through the night, durring the day I am so cramped up (and having very nasty smelling burps) that I can't eat or take it anymore. I wish it could've worked to help me as it has seemed to help so many others. But after the first four days of that I was ready to call it quits. I started and stopped 2 other meds at the time I started taking the saphris, so its taken about 3 weeks figuring out that it was the culprit. If only I could have been warned or read a review of this happening to other people. nasty experience",1,"February 13, 2016",7
Saphris,Schizophrenia,"I take Saphris 25 mg every day. I have BIPOLAR/SCHIZOAFFECTIVE/OCD/PTSD. I has been 2 1/2 weeks and it is helping a ton! Negatives: kinda annoying to take but you'll get use to it.  It is a tablet that you put under your tongue and wait for 10 min. to eat or drink. It just came out with a  black-cherry taste which tastes like a little piece of candy. Other negative are  headache, some insomnia but then sometimes it will help a lot with sleep. I think the insomnia is due to  my caffeine intake. So if you really want this medicine to work, don't use pop/coffee, big pupils. Positives: calmer, deeper and longer sleep, increased motivation, weight loss, decreased irritability, more stable mood, more creative, can pay attention more, more creativity, and more clear mind..",9,"May 15, 2015",54

Overall-compared to the other anti-psychotics out there, pretty good stuff man.",8,"February 14, 2015",30
Saphris,Schizophrenia,"I was put on Saphris after being on Clozaril for 13 years.  My schizophrenia is completely controlled on this medicine.  However, it is much less sedating than Clozaril and sleep is sometimes a challenge.  It also seems to not increase my appetite-- the first of its kind!  For awhile it was also prolonging the QT wave of my heart but that seems to have leveled off.  But I do have one major complaint.  It sometimes makes me forget how to pronounce words.  I guess this is similar to an effect of Topamax.  All things said, its good to be almost normal.",9,"December 8, 2013",41
Saphris,Schizophrenia,I have been on Saphris for two and a half months now. So far it has been great. My eating is under control compared to when I was on Invega. So far I have lost 3kg due to diet and exercise. Hope to lose some more weight. The only side effect I will complain about is my extended sleep. I sleep for 12-15 hours a day. A bit of a worry for when I am trying to get back to work.,10,"August 4, 2013",34
Saphris,Schizophrenia,"I'm 28 and was just diagnosed with Schizophrenia about a month ago. I was given Saphris, this is my first antipsychotic medication and it makes me immensely drowsy after 10 minutes. It slowed down the racing thoughts and negative ideas in my head in order to set aside my wants and needs and socially accept what is happening around me and what I need to do. Only down side so far is the intense drowsiness and that gnawing restless sleep feeling when I tried to go to sleep before my regular sleeping schedule. I can't remember falling asleep at all due to the tossing and turning. I do recommend taking it when you're 100% positive your going to sleep and not a moment sooner. Woke up calm and well rested.

Saphris,Schizophrenia,"I have been on SEVERAL medications over my many years (36 years old now). I have been on medications for over 20 years off and on. I have been on Saphris for almost 3 weeks now and I can not tell you what a God send this has been.  My doc just added Lithium to my regimen and as he refers to it, it is like Batman and Robin. Batman works great but can sometimes use the help of Robin.  The only thing is it can be cost prohibiting without insurance. ",9,"April 16, 2012",34
Saphris,Schizophrenia,"It seems to have calmed the ranting, raving, racing thoughts in my mind, and I have not heard any voices, or bad thoughts against myself or others. It is also helping me with quitting my smoking addiction. The racing thoughts have always triggered smoking needs but now I find myself going much longer times with out worries and need to smoke. I'm staying on task better also. I'm on Depakote ER, Invega, Cogentin, Lexapro, Abilify and Saphrise is a very pleasant surprise.",8,"April 14, 2012",29

I've tried Abilify, Risperdal, Geodon, Fanapt, Latuda, Loxitane and others as well as an array of Antidepressants and Antianxiety pills. It is very bitter, but I have to say I sleep GREAT now! I will try to put more on here as my treatment continues.",8,"March 6, 2012",26
Saphris,Schizophrenia,Saphris was incredible for a few months as far as stopping the symptoms and no side effects.  We missed my wife's dose by 2 hours and the wheels fell off and she had to fall back on Zyprexa again.  It's a medicine we may go back to if the Invega stops working.,7,"March 4, 2012",18
Saphris,Schizophrenia,"I'm happy. I've tried all medicines for schizophrenia on the Australian market, this just came out here. I've been on it for a couple of months and my old depot of flucopanthixol is washing out now. I'm pretty amazed at how little side effects. I can wake up in the mornings and have sex. I suffered from female sex dysfuction and/or somnolence for years, I was so unhappy with both those scenarios. Now I'm only sleeping about 9,10 hours and I can date and romance. As far as these anti psychotics go this is the best for me. Still makes me a little sleepy and sedated but am approaching normalcy again for the first time in 20 years. Its easier on my heart as well, can go a lot further in my workouts. ",9,"January 22, 2012",31

Has helped my depression so much it's amazing.  I was severely suicidal and had been for at least 2 years with two serious attempts.  Not suicidal any more.  Also, sometimes I'm even able to socialize pretty normally.  Take it with Prozac, Adderall and Neurontin.",9,"November 1, 2011",24
Saphris,Schizophrenia,"For the first few weeks, I felt amazing. So much better, I couldn't believe it. I hadn't been that totally free from visions with any other medication. I didn't much enjoy randomly falling asleep when I took my afternoon dose, but at the time it seemed worth it. However, after about a month, I started feeling like the best thing for me to do would be to kill myself. I didn't get depressed, none of my old symptoms returned, I just felt like it was the logical thing to do. It felt so normal that I didn't report it to my doctor for a month. He told me to stop taking Saphris and within 2 weeks all of my suicidal thoughts stopped. My symptoms returned, but it was a fair trade. I just want people to know and to be careful.",3,"October 23, 2011",47
Saphris,Schizophrenia,"I been on so many medications. This one is the best medication I have been on. The only negative is that it makes me sleepy when I take the medication. Overall, this medication is great because you don't have to worry about the voices.",8,"May 22, 2011",28
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"I was put on Seroquel to help me sleep at night when I went into a Drug Addiction treatment center about 3 months ago for opioids. Seroquel is completely awful in my opinion. Did it make me sleep? for sure!! But let me tell you the side effects are awful! I would wakeup the next day and all day long I would sweat like a pig (even after detoxing), after about 2 weeks I noticed I had restless legs SO bad to where my legs would start aching and eventually my arms were restless also. At night after taking it I would become extremely hungry. Also I am diagnosed with depression and not bipolar disorder so  noticed I started to feel extremely panicky/ couldn't stop moving. I stopped cold turkey getting off of this drug, I couldn't handle it one more day.",2,"November 25, 2020",1
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"Seroquel is terrible. I felt completely disassociated. I knew words were coming out of my mouth but sometimes had no clue what I was saying. 
I was only on it for a few month but I called my Dr. in a panic when I’d realized the weight I’d gained. I lost 100 lbs in my 20’s and been able to keep it off give or take 10lbs, I’m now 40 years old and I instantly put on belly/waist weight, a place where I have NEVER have gained before. I know my body well & this was pretty extreme. I went up a pant size in 2 months. I told my dr. And he said it makes you crave carbs but I KNOW it’s more than that. What type of meds make you gain weight in a specific area? After loosing the 10-15 lbs, I am stuck with saggy skin after 3 months! It’s not worth it. It created a whole new set of permanent problems like saggy skin & my confidence with undressing around my husband. Horrible!",1,"November 9, 2020",10
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"My doctor put me on this medication to help not just my Bipolar Disorder but also for my extreme  anxiety and agitation I was having. However, since I am a senior who has had sleep apnea since 1991 and use a CPAP machine every night. I suffer from very bad daytime sleepiness  and memory problems. I will NEVER take this again! I was only on 25 mg for two days but I felt like a zombie and  very spaced out. My wife almost could not wake me up at 11:00am and it was all I could do to get out of bed. I had to get up since I have diabetes type 2 and need to eat something in order to take my medication. I advise anyone with Sleep Apnea to think twice before you let you doctor prescribe this for you.",1,"November 9, 2020",7
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"I got very sick, and was put into the ICU for a very long time which caused ICU Delirium and Depression.  I had been on Cymbalta, but they changed it to Seroquel.  My friends who are nurses make jokes about how awesome Seroquel is for shutting patients up and making them comply.

I felt awful on this drug.  Leg spasms, drooling, worsened diabetes, etc.  They didn't tell me that they'd put me on it.  When someone finally told me, I demanded they take me off of it, and the drooling and spasms stopped almost immediately.  And I was able to stay awake, and think more clearly.  And able to participate in physical therapy.

I didn't notice any mood improvements and in fact I was incredibly depressed, but being in the ICU is traumatic, and I had a machine breathing for me, and I was trying to process having almost died.

I would recommend trying just about everything else first.  I've told my doctors they're never putting me on it again.",1,"September 5, 2020",27
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"I have Affective bipolar disorder and took Seroquel for 12 years started at 100mg , last 8 years 300mg night. I had psychotic suicidal depression. Yes it made me sleep well except towards end restless legs. It never stopped the depressions from recurring nor could I sleep with it during  the bouts.  A year ago a psych stopped it cold turkey or over 5 days. Instantly I developed tardive dyskinesia TD a debilitating progressive neurological condition . Very uncomfortable,
painful and no, I would not recommend it. I am 63 having to start a new life, homebound, super self conscious of my face, avoid meeting people",3,"September 2, 2020",24
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"This drug Seroquel made me feel like a zombie. Sure it would make me feel ""normal"" but it would completely knock me out. I was with some friends and I was going to give them a ride home from my house and accidentally took my medication too early and I literally passed out and they had to get a ride from a friend. I was only at a 50 mg dose. This medication was just not for me. I take Latuda now, which made me really drowsy when I first started taking it but I have since gotten over it.",2,"June 1, 2020",27
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"I can, now, see my own sign of mania or depression (having had Dialectical Behavioral therapy for six months). With that said, the meds are not miracles and after some dialectical treatment to add to my “tool box”... seroquel really helps. When I am restless, racing thoughts and moody I feel well balance after about 48-72 hours after using “coping skills” plus adding seroquel to prevent lack of sleep which induces worsening of thoughts, moods, eating, etc. For me, it’s very helpful to have self-relaxation skills to level my reactions. I give this medication, after months of skill work, A++. My experience is not to say it is 100% fluent to all bipolar sufferers. Good thing DBT is not a medication so won’t hurt to try it as a “tool”.  The side-effects are mild. It does make me drowsy and sometimes do get oily face... yet, I can accept that over extended episodes. I also have to keep drinking lots of water as dry mouth is mild and do feel thirsty.",10,"May 2, 2020",28
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"I suffer from Bipolar II, take 200mg Lamictal daily, and was prescribed 25mg Seroquel to take at night to help me sleep during hypomanic episodes. My psychiatrist claimed it would calm the racing thoughts, help me fall asleep, and hopefully make me think more clearly during the day.

After taking it, I would still be awake for a couple hours trying to sleep and still having racing thoughts. In the morning, I had the worst experiences trying to wake up. I wasn’t trying to wake up early or anything, like 11 on my free days so I could sleep in, and even then I could barely open my eyes enough to turn off my alarm and would immediately fall back asleep. After finally waking up, I felt groggy and disoriented throughout the day. I couldn’t think straight, and was unable to focus during my classes. Not a good experience. I only took it a few times, and decided it was only having negative effects so I stopped taking it.",1,"February 20, 2020",36
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,I have been on Seroquel off and on for three years. I have tried other meds for my Bipolar Disorder but nothing has worked better for me. I feel the only drawback is waking up in the morning with a cloudy head and dry mouth.,9,"February 19, 2020",32
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"Thank you everyone for sharing your views. For those that Seroquel has helped,  how many weeks did it take to feel relief from the agitation? I have been on this for a week and don't feel less agitated yet, only too drowsy to yell as much after I take it for a period.",6,"January 24, 2020",39
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"They don't call it the demon drug for nothing. I was prescribed 25 mg in the evening for extreme irritability and ""insomnia"" off label. I cut it in half because I'm relatively small at 115 pounds. Knocked me out like a light. Went up to 50 mg and became nauseous, saw stars, heart palpitations, and my body felt extremely heavy. Stopped taking immediately after.

Please note that the mood stabilizing effect only kicks in at a minimum dosage of 100 mg. Anything under that is a sedative, like Benadryl on steroids with the added benefit of developing akinesia and metabolic syndrome. You WILL gain weight on this drug regardless of dosage. On the bright side, it'll get rid of your allergy sniffles.",4,"January 14, 2020",38
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"This drug absolutely did not work for me. Well the sleeping part worked.... I never slept so much in my life. Instead of waking up from 12 hours of sleep feeling well rested, I woke up angry and wanting to punch someone in the face. Sure I can have anger outbursts but only while on Seroquel did I want to punch someone. Started low at 25mg and my doctor kept increasing my dosage to 100.mg At 100mg, I would sleep 18 hours straight and my days and nights were blurred. The anger caused me great urges to drink alcohol, which is ironic because I don't even like alcohol. Eventually just stopped cold turkey and to this day I have never woken up as miserable as I was on Seroquel. Also I gained 60 pounds in a little over 2 months and had severe impotence. So definitely not for me.",2,"January 3, 2020",46
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"Seroquel did not feel like it was doing anything for me the first month and a half in terms of my mood because it was the only med I was on. It did help me sleep again --  but I can't say it saved me from all of the racing thoughts and rapid cycling when up. 
As someone with Bipolar Disorder who experiences severe depressive phases, two doses of Lithium Carbonate, Gabapentin as needed for anxiety, and Seroquel 150mg at night for sleep  is what is best for me. 
I guess how it forces me to fall asleep and stay asleep is what in turn effects my mood to be more relaxed the next day. Who wouldn't be relaxed when they sleep 8-12 hours a night lol. Other than that effect I do not notice a big difference in my mood change like I do with other meds.",9,"January 3, 2020",25
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"Seroquel is an excellent choice for stabilizing the mood and improving sleep in the context of a Bipolar disorder.  
I have Bipolar II mood disorder and recently experienced chronic sleeplessness and angry-agitated moods.  The day of my medical appointment I became overtly angry in two separate social circumstances. These angry reactions are very hurtful to those who experience the triggered anger.

I found a doctor who SPECIALISES in this disorder and is up to date with the latest research findings in this specific condition. If you don't like your current GP or Psych's attitude, find someone else! I started a combo of Lamictal (AM & PM) & Seroquel (Only PM - makes you drowsy). I kept a daily mood diary & it took 3 months for my mood to fully stabilise. To help the bipolar depression, we added bupropion & N-Acetyl Cysteine, a supplement (all based on clinical research!).

Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"THIS WAS MY EXPERIENCE...
I have been fighting mental disorders since age 14. During the 40+ years. I have been prescribed tricyclics, typical antipsychotics, SSRIs SNRIs Benzos (diazapam when 16 years old). I chemically blew out my brain, specifically the serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways, by doing LSD from 1978 through 1981. It was the '70's.  So now at the edge of 60, I have horrible reactions  to psychotrophics. Seroquel paralyzed my arms and legs after my nightly 1 to 3 hours of sleep, such that I had to lay there until I could use my left arm to pick up my right arm, then with both free, I used them to get my legs going. I took it for about 4 years, with the above side effects plus the helicopters whizzing through my brain and body. To me, it is a nasty drug.  I finally got sick of it. tossed the remaining pills, went loopy. My partner thought I was going to die. I lived.",1,"September 22, 2019",29

Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"I have bipolar mania with stages of depression. It has been like this since I was very young. It comes along with episodes of mood swings. I am on 25 mg of Seroquel now and have been on both 50mg and 100 mg. 25 mg does great things for me. No more sleepless nights. No more intense spending sprees. No more major anxiety most of the time. A lot less depression and a lot less irritability I experienced as well. I get tired and a little unmotivated in the morning, but I have coffee and breakfast and I'm good. Weight gain is the other concerns but I have controlled it with walking good amounts each day. Well worth a try and definitely something to consider for a bipolar patient.",8,"September 4, 2019",57
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"This medication has saved my life. I was having the worst episodes ever high low high low, no sleep, totally impulsive on the downward spiral to self destruction. Spending money running around town all hours, telling off people at work... then the crash. Sobbing in my doctor's office, she wrote the script for Seroquel. I had zero faith, because all the anti-depressants etc. she'd tried me on never worked to calm the chaos/PTSD reactivity in my head. I was ready to end it all. Thank goodness I filled the script and took it. I slept! That in itself is a miracle. I kept my job, and I'm hopefully on a journey to wellness. My mind is calmer. I can think one thing after another in a logical order instead of a cloud of white noise and traumatic memories flashing. I think with this med and some good PTSD therapy I might have a second chance... at life. I don't care if I gain a little weight... I want to live without constant chaos.

I take Seroquel at night with Lamictal, and Lithium twice daily. The Seroquel is a must for me. After five years of flashbacks, panic attacks, and night terrors over my rape, I can finally get a full night of sleep. I have asthma and it doesn't bother it, and I'm on 100mg per night. I saw one reviewer say do not take seroquel if you have asthma. The truth is EVERYONE is different. Seroquel works great for me.",9,"February 5, 2016",36

Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,I was on this med in 2010 for a year. The dose went from 25mg up to 400mg. The first few weeks were very difficult. It knocked me out cold and I had such a blocked nose I could hardly breathe. I toughed it out and my depression lifted. I stopped taking it because of really bad blocked nose. I have just had a major depressive episode (2015) with insomnia. I was prescribed 100mg. It worked within 24 hours. I was able to sleep for 9 hours and feel refreshed and energized. The depression and anxiety have improved dramatically. This time I'll stay on Seroquel.,10,"February 1, 2016",43

Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"I have a child on Seroquel.  We've tried Abilify, Risperdal, and Geodon to no avail.  Seroquel seems to keep her psychotic symptoms at a whisper instead of shouting in her head.  My husband has also used Seroquel for his schizoaffective disorder.  He switched to Risperdal because the Seroquel was sedating when ingesting over 50mg and he needed doses during the day.

Our daughter is on an average of 500mg a day with no sedating effects whatsoever and we're wondering if she just does not do well on this class of drug since 600mg a day is the highest she can safely go for her age.  Nothing seems to keep her psychotic symptoms completely in check, particularly her paranoia.",5,"January 27, 2016",10
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,I am on 600 mg a day 2x300. It is being used to help with depressive episodes of bipolar which I get more than the highs.

Now in 2016 I am willing to try again. I fought my Dr for many years and she insisted that If I would only listen to her that I would feel much better and not have to suffer with my rollercoaster emotions. The down is so bad now that I finally couldn't stand myself any longer so I  told her I'm willing to try Seroquel. I took it for a month only to find out that it causes VERY low libido. I know that sanity is more important than a libido, but come on!!! Isn't there an RX that works like Seroquel without the low libido effect?

Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"I'm not sure how I feel about this drug helping with my bipolar. I'm on lamictal for that and was put on seroquel to help with it until I was on a high enough dosage of that and truly did not feel it made any difference. I have stayed on a low dose of seroquel simply because I LOVE the sedative effects. If there was an option on here for the reason we were taking it was ""insomnia"" I would have put that. I never realized how awful I was sleeping until this medicine. 50mg a night and I get an amazing nights sleep. No more waking up to every little sound despite sleeping with a noise maker. It's amazing.",6,"January 15, 2016",24
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"I was put on Seroquel for severe anxiety and suspected bipolar.  Let me begin with this.  Do not EVER TAKE THIS IF YOU HAVE ASTHMA.  You know that horrible drying effect that many antihistamines have resulting in asthma attacks?  This is much worse.  I started out with an 8th of a tablet (12.5mg).  This gave me a calm,  sleepy feeling that would put me to sleep for bed and would last until roughly 5pm the next day.  But when I upped the dose to 37.2mg I had a really bad asthma attack, heart pounding and my ears rang which lasted 2 weeks after I discontinued the med.  Not a pleasant experience for someone with severe anxiety.  Be very cautious.  Up the dosage more slowly than the MD recommends. I was to start 50mg/night",3,"January 13, 2016",13

Was prescribed this years back, and slowly I saw my life start to tangle up.  Mood problems got worse, could not feel much remorse or feelings, just dampened emotions that got harder to control.   I strongly believe this medicine harmed my mental health during one of the times the brain develops significantly.  Been off for exactly a year and still recovering.  Finally I can sleep through the night after about 10 months, but still dealing and slowly on the way back from a miserable journey of anxiety, insomnia, and instability. Mood should arguably be stabilized, not muted and worsened by this medication. Be safe",1,"November 28, 2015",32
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"Seroquel helped with my panic attacks and break downs, but it made me feel lifeless (which I prefer versus crying).

One day after taking my medication and then sleeping 10 hours, I then got in my car and was driving somewhere and feel asleep at the wheel. I total my car but luckily I wasn't hurt and no one else was involved. I lost my job. The ""best"" part though was the 110 pound weight gain I had in less then a year of taking this poison.

Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,Seroquel is great. Been taking it for seven years. I take 200mg at night for bipolar. It does take time to get used to it. I does cause me to get hungry 30 minute's after taking in it. Just eat a healthy snack. At first I did gain a couple pounds. Searching on line did not help. Everyone's complains how much you need to eat. It's self control. I make sure to exercise everyday. And trust me it's no easy. There's day I have no energy. But I tell my self I have 3 little girl's and have to make sure I do not get fat and unhealthy. I have bad mood swings with out it.

All in all though I do feel more balanced, productive and a better sense of self purpose and an ability to plan realistically on this drug.

Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,"This was the first anti-psychotic I was put on, I was pushed into it by my psychiatrist at the time. I was on a low dose, 150mg. I took it for four months before taking myself off it due to extreme tiredness and horrific weight gain...I gained over 2.5 stones in the time I was on it, despite managing my food intake very carefully and exercising rigorously.

A couple of years later I wound up being prescribed Seroquel again, this time at 300mg. Same as last time it really knocked me out and once again I gained weight.

This med did nothing for my mood, but I kept being told to 'give the medication time to work.' After 6 months I came off it again. Since weaning off the med I haven't slept properly, and that was almost 3 months ago.",2,"October 2, 2015",19

I walk around with a smile on my face, no longer feel anxious in social situations and nothing seems insurmountable (and I went through recovery from surgery, a breakup and living with my ex through COVID lockdown on this medication). It’s a game changer for me! I’m on 50mg/day.  Give it time to work because it’s worth going through the horrific side effects to feel like I do.

I could go to the grocery store ! I was able to clean my kitchen ! Without needing a nap ! I still wasn’t quite there after a few weeks , (need to be more functioning) so increased to 150mg .

Sertraline,Depression,"I have major/severe depression and have been on a variety of SSRI's/SSNRI's/NDRI's and Sertraline is great but for a few wrong reasons. The anxiety/OCD/rage was worse than the depression though. I've been on Sertraline (100mg) for a collective 4 years and its pretty much done the same thing: It ELIMINATES anxiety, OCD and rage/anger issues. It's better than benzos in doing it as well. The problem is what is doesn't do: For me, it had no effect on the depression/mood (which was the point?). 
Side effects: Fatigue (like a zombie), yawning, feeling disconnected, and makes you have terrible quality sleep.If you're a male, it makes it difficult to ejaculate.

In closing, I would use this for major anxiety/OCD/PTSD/anger issues, but it doesn't lift your mood. Side effects aside, it will change your life, but please get a sleeping tablet as well.",9,"May 3, 2020",35

Up and down over the next 4 weeks then up to 100, On that for 8 weeks  and again happy a few days, low a few days. Felt it maybe wasn’t working which I was distraught about, but these reviews really helped. So many times I thought about giving up but many reviews said to persevere. Side effects of nausea/increased anxiety can be horrible but isn’t 24/7. Propanolol 10mgs and diazepam 2mgs helped.  Up to 150mg and again happy days bad days. Nearly gave up again. Now been on 150mg over 8 wks and eureka! Happy, calm, positive, sociable, fun. So if this sounds like you, please please persevere!

Sertraline,Depression,"Zoloft (sertraline):			“I was put on Zoloft a month ago. I'd gone to my doctor after a recent breakup and mentioned I had really bad anxiety attacks throughout my last relationship as he'd cheated on me and it was an emotional traumatising. My doctor prescribed me with Zoloft. 
Within a week I was having active suicidal thoughts, I went back to the doctors and said something felt wrong. They said I should let the antidepressants settle in over a six week period and it would be all fine.
Taking this advice I stayed on it - then a few days later  I tried to overdose and was hospitalised. The psychiatrists were so shocked I'd been prescribed Zoloft and said doctors are often too quick to medicate. 
It was the scariest experience of my life, and I'd warn anyone else who is prescribed this to really think about it. Now instead of working through the emotions of a break up I was working through the pain of a mental illness bought on by antidepressants.",2,"December 20, 2019",40
Sertraline,Depression,Was great at first. Had energy and felt awesome. Then I started getting tired and having NO motivation. So they upped it finally hitting 200mg. Still tired.

Sertraline,Depression,"Zoloft (sertraline):			“It made me feel a little better- it lifted the sadness that I feel all the time but only slightly. I still feel the depression, and it has made my positive emotions feel weaker, almost like the things that made me happy aren’t as powerful anymore. My OCD has worsened and the (very) slight improvement in mood is outweighed by the negatives I’ve experienced. 

Overall, my anxiety is less and I feel less fragile. As time goes on this effect is becoming less strong, but the side effects remain. I am going to talk to my doctor about switching, it’s been 6 weeks with little improvement.",4,"December 18, 2019",17

This was then accompanied by nausea,  headaches, insomnia and restlessness. 
I have never felt side effects like these before on any medicine.
The restlessness is exhausting and lack of sleep is unbearable. I hope my doctor will agree to take me off sertraline at my next appointment.",2,"December 18, 2019",2
Sertraline,Depression,"Use sertraline for depression, anxiety, ptsd and tourettes, works a charm.
I've been using it for a few months now, you have to be very careful with dosage, as I accidentally went on to 200mg instead of 100mg for a while and was completely out of it, shoplifted and just felt like a husk. But now I'm back to normal on my 100mg dose, this really saved me, alongside therapy. Side effects aren't that bad considering the positives of it. I have energy and motivation and I feel silly and giddy like I used to, I feel like me. 
My side effects have been mainly achieving orgasm, increased libido as someone else said, so it is hard to deal with that, urine retention? I think thats the word, vivid dreams, but they're rarely nightmares anymore so thats great, loss of appetite and thats about it for now. Side affects were worse when starting it, my previous nightmares went haywire, but after a while that settled down",10,"December 15, 2019",15
Sertraline,Depression,"Zoloft (sertraline):			“I been on Zoloft for 9 years. Side effects are different every time. I started taking these meds for panic disorder. Then had PPD after my 2nd child. So took them again.  My starting dose was  at 100mg and got  down to 50mg, and now at 175mg. I think depression is worse for me than anxiety. Also not being familiar with all the horrible side effects of depression makes it scary. But being afraid of depression only brings in anxiety with it. Anxiety and depression together is the worst! So I try not to let it freak me out. I've been extremely sleepy during the day ever since I went up to 175mg. It's been like 3 months. I missed my 11am dosage and started feeling lots of anxiety so I took it at 8:30pm. Now I'm wondering if it will help me sleep at night and not be so tired during the day?

Prior to taking medication, it was a challenge for me to even get out of bed and accomplish simple daily tasks, my depression was debilitating. My anxiety was so bad I would overthink simple things like going to the store and would be too nervous to leave my house, I had trouble talking to people, social settings were always a NO.  Now with Sertraline, I have found myself again. I'm on top of things, I'm finishing college with a 4.0 and completing my Nursing Degree, I'm active and enjoy venturing out and it doesn't cross my mind to over analyze social settings, talking comes easy now.

Sertraline,Depression,I first took sertraline around 14 yrs old. Worked wonders for years. I went from not even being able to leave my home without a puke bucket-to being fine. I could eat again without getting sick. My original doctor told me that anti depressants can loose effectiveness over time the doctor I seen today told me I probably just went through intense depressive episodes that made us think it was losing its magic. Or chemistry. Same doctor has taken me off remeron and put me back on sertraline. I hope it does the same for me now that it did those years ago. It was great then. Even helped me fight off the urge that I get from Trichotillomania and my OCD tendencies.,9,"December 12, 2019",6
Sertraline,Depression,"Zoloft (sertraline):			“I started on Zoloft exactly 3 months ago. 25mg for two days, then 50mg for two days, then 75, then 100. I noticed a change immediately, likely due to placebo. My mood levelled out pretty quick once I hit 100 to a neutral place without the low low days. At 3 weeks I was scheduled to go up to 150mg (and did) and stayed on that dose for a month. Low mood crept back in gradually and then several days in a row. 2 weeks ago, I was upped to 200mg and at this point I am still waiting for it to really take effect. My doctor did mention it could take around 2 weeks. 

-Physical anxiety: (racing heart, trouble slowing breathing) 2.5 weeks, attributed to caffeine consumption- no longer can have more than 1 cup a day (coffee). 
-Exhaustion: 2 days at each dose increase. 
-Insomnia: whole time. Trazodone prescribed

Sertraline,Depression,"Zoloft (sertraline):			“I was put on Zoloft when I started feeling the blues being pregnant with my son and been on it for 3 years. Yes, the blues had went away, but I found myself to have to sense of urgency, like that piece of me is gone. Not appreciating what I have and just not caring about much. I’m a supervisor and it’s affecting my job duties. I feel like my critical thinking is gone. I’m going to be weaning myself off it because it’s not  good for my lifestyle. I’m going to try my best to be more fit and take better care of my home and pay more attention to what I have. I’ve come so far in life to not be able to appreciate it. I need the old me back.

Sertraline,Depression,"Seemed to take away the depression, in some sort of way, but there was a reason for that.

Sertraline (Zoloft) turns you in to a nothing, so of course you feel better. You feel nothing.

I spent over two years on Sertraline and was incapable of doing anything.

Sleeping 20 hours a day was normal. Would easily have been 24 but I forced myself to get up because I knew I should. On those days I absolutely forced myself to get up at a reasonable hour ie 12.00 mid day, I would be asleep again by 2.00pm.

Then BAM! I came off it by accident (ran out of Sertraline and couldn’t get to the chemist.

Yes, I got bad dreams. Yes I got headaches but then:

Woah! I’m back! Absolutely fine and pumping with life!

How long had I been fine? 6 months? A year? 18 months? I’ll never know. But I was absolutely fine.

I had to stop work for several days. Doc told me to get off them on day 13 when I was rock bottom and am now trying a different type of antidepressants so do keep your doctor informed on whatever seems unusual and try make sure someone close to you knows about the side effects and that it may increase suicidal ideation. take care and may you be well",1,"November 21, 2019",12

I tried switching over to the 100 mg Zoloft - WORSE.  The 50 mg Zoloft has kept me stable all of these decades and Pfizer no longer manufactures that EXACT pill.  Of course I contacted them; they won't do a thing. Sounds crazy but there is SUCH a devastating Difference.",1,"November 21, 2019",42

For the first two weeks I didn’t really notice any difference with my anxiety or depression, but the side effects were pretty much limited to heightened anxiety. A few days ago though it was like a switch was flipped. My low mood has completely gone and while my anxiety is still present, it’s reduced my at least 50%. I’m also sleeping less but feeling so much more energised and ready to take on anything.

A few days ago I felt symptoms coming on and took one. Worst experience of my life. 
Severe nausea, diarrhoea, worsening of headache, chest pains, numb pain in left arm, muscle clenching involuntarily, Jaw pain, severe anxiety. Ended up in ER crying and feeling like I was high on drugs.

Sumatriptan,Migraine,"I get monthly hormonal migraines (during my period), and sometimes one in the middle of the cycle. They are really, really bad. Before Sumatriptan I had to stay in bed all day, snacking on Tylenol like candy (without much effect). 
Sumatriptan does work. The key is to take it as early as possible. Just when you feel the first tingles of pain - take it. Usually in 30-40 minutes I am pain free. It does come with pretty nasty side effects. For me it's extreme weakness, very heavy feeling arms and legs, low blood pressure and general feel of being unwell. So even after taking it, I have to take it easy - just stay comfortable, watch a movie, read a book, and stay in bed. I usually feel so weak, I can barely walk. But it sure as anything beats being in such a severe pain that you consider calling an ambulance.",8,"November 21, 2019",15

I find them unpleasant to take and my headache intensifies for several minutes after administration. Now that I have been on them for so long they aren’t as effective as they were and the headache usually dulls rather than disappears, I also often have to take two for the same migraine. I haven’t found anything else that works as well however. I am lucky living in Scotland where prescriptions are free but am aware these injections can be expensive.",9,"November 1, 2019",2

Lately after taking a 75mg dose I've woken up feeling very weird with grogginess, brain fog and derealization/depersonalization symptoms that I can't shake. It is very scary.

I cut down to 50 and still got to sleep, 25mg was hard to sleep, but after cutting to 0 I cannot sleep period so I'm going to stay at 25mg for a while and hope my sleep readjusts. I hate having to take this. If you can't sleep naturally please find natural means. 0.3mg melatonin is all your body needs per night to fall asleep. Drugs are addicting prescribed or not, and they can permanently change your neuropathways so you need them when you didn't before taking them.

Trazodone,Insomnia,I've had depression induced insomnia the last 3 years. I am so thankful for Quetiapine because I was finally able to sleep and sleep WELL. But a side effect is weight gain and I also feel if I don't take it with food or on a full stomach it won't work. So my Dr. prescribed trazodone in 50mg to try. I HATE NOT SLEEPING. Last night over an hour after taking 100mg I wasn't even tired. I tried to go to bed and after googling it- I took another 50mg....I was in a light sleep on and off and now I'm up early.

I was waking about 4-5 times a night for unknown reasons.  I was really hoping that trazodone would help me stay asleep.  I never took more that 50mg at one time because of the reported side effects at higher doses.  Unfortunately, the drug did not help me stay asleep. But, it did cause a terrible case of dry mouth which woke me up off and on all night to drink water.  I also had some blurry vision problems in the mornings which went away by noon. So, I discontinued the drug. The dry mouth and blurry vision went away immediately.   I am going to give trazodone fair rating because I am certain it works for some people, just not for me.  Good luck to the others who try it.",5,"September 2, 2020",26

Trazodone,Insomnia,"My doctor's been trying to get me off Ambien for chronic insomnia because of supposed side-effects with long-term use and prescribed me trazodone. But trazodone either made me very drowsy the next day when I took the full dose, or didn't get me to sleep for very long when I cut it in half. Since it takes longer to work, taking half a dose in the middle of the night was useless. I also had bad dreams many times, some nausea, my nasal passages seemed to get constricted, making breathing not so smooth and gave me slight headaches. With all that, I became moody. I never had any of these issues with Ambien. I will say that when I did fall asleep with trazodone, I slept good and hard. But out of the week I tried trazodone, I had only one full night of good sleep. The other nights were pretty miserable, mainly because I couldn't get enough sleep.",2,"August 25, 2020",25

Trazodone,Insomnia,I've been intermittently on anti-depressants since age 16. I am now 70 and realise depression/anxiety will always be with me. Many years ago I also started getting early-morning waking. My doc put me on Trazodone for the first time in June 2014 and I have to say the difference between that and the 'classic' anti-depressants I'd been on (most recently Lofepramine and Citalopram)  was striking. It doesn't give me any of the side-effects I've had before. I've had three periods on Trazodone since then with a 3 year break since Sept 2017. I have resumed taking it in Aug 2020 to curb my early-morning waking again and reduce the exhaustion and low mood associated with it,10,"August 7, 2020",28

I actually feel my anxiety getting worse as I wake up in panic and I can feel my heart beating fast. I love that I’m able to sleep but I hate the side effects.

After reading some reviews I will share what the pharmacist instructed me to do, I have not had any side effects. Take 30 mins before bed, with a snack, more than a couple of crackers but obviously not a heavy meal, stay upright for those 30 mins. Pharmacist said it will bother my stomach if I don’t.

It's not going to pay off instantly, but in time you will see an improvement of your skin. Remember to use SPF on your face  everyday, because Retin-A peels off the first layer of your skin, and it's very delicate.

I was switched to Triumeq in late Feb, 2016, NOT due to having a detectable viral load, but due to increasing diarrhea on my last drug combination which included Epzicom, Norvir & Prezista. I wish I never complained about the diarrhea because I am still suffering from extreme headaches nine (9) days after stopping Triumeq.

Now iv decided to start taking the medication in Dec 2015, cos I was worried about the strain on my immune system and the cuts in government in general.

By all accounts I am very active and have a vigorous job that needs me to be alert. This med has worn me down physically and emotionally. I have no energy and Bad headaches. My body is achy constantly and the overall feeling of waiting to puke. I had to remove myself from work untilll I can figure if this is indeed the results of medication. I am beginning to think it is. The labs will tell more. I have never experienced sides before on any other meds. I was switching because of cholesterol #'s. I will most likely go back to Atripila.

The pathology tells the story the best:

Last tests before treatment: CD4- 670, VL 36,900

4 weeks after commencing treatment - CD4- 793, VL 43

Triumeq,HIV/AIDS,I have been on triumeq for over 3 months now with little or if any side effects I was diagnosed with HIV in October 2013 my body was doing ok with the virus my cd4 count was around 500 but a high viral load for the first 2 years of infection I decided in October 2015 to start medication I was told by my doctor it would either be atripla or triumeq being in the UK where our nhs provides a free wonderful service I was hoping for triumeq given the lesser side effects and was worried about atripla which is a more regimented medication having told my doctor sometimes I work nights meant that atripla was ruled out as it should be taken before sleeping due to possible side effects so I was prescribed triumeq ,10,"February 25, 2016",13

I used to take Paxil CR, but if I didn't take it absolutely on time, or whatever,...I was off for a week (or in jail).. no, I'm not kidding, my depression has taken me places you don't wanna know... My experience today is that I actually feel happier than I have in months... I guess I'm lucky that way! :)",10,"October 2, 2020",67
Zoloft,Depression,"Last February-April I had a really bad bout with anxiety and depression I tried Prozac and Cymbalta and had really bad side effects with both of them. I started 25mg of Zoloft in May 2020. About a Month later I went to 50mg and now am up to 75mg. I may even consider going to 100mg. The Anxiety was better pretty quickly...the fatigue/depression took a bit longer...still some improvement needed, but so much better. I have also noticed that my PMS is barely noticeable.  Very little to no agitation in the days before my period. My advice would be to increase slowly and allow time for improvement. It is gradual and can take months...but worth the wait.",10,"September 23, 2020",68
Zoloft,Depression,"About 6 weeks ago, I started Zoloft at 25 mg for GAD, mild depression, and some PTSD and OCD symptoms. Before you continue reading, please understand that my experience likely will not be yours, as is the case with every single review you'll read. Do not be scared to start. It absolutely helped. My overall mood didn't change much, but it helped the physical symptoms of my anxiety and helped me cope with my life stresses. I began to enjoy doing things I love again. I still had bad days, but I was overall functioning well and productive, although I still had not the best outlook on life. Side effects I experienced: insomnia, daily headaches similar to hangovers, shakiness, increased depression the first week, decreased appetite, menstrual changes, and decreased libido. Again, this is just my experience. Do not be afraid to give it a try, people are much more likely to leave negative reviews, I just wanted to leave a review to help others. Best of luck, you've got this!",6,"September 3, 2020",137
Zoloft,Depression,"I refuse to let what happened to me happen to anyone else. I’m 18 year old petite female. I began taking 25mg of zoloft for anxiety and mild depression. On day 3, I experienced serotonin shock syndrome. I woke up suddenly in the middle of the night with my entire body shaking, my heart rate extremely high, and extremely confused. My parents took me to the ER after I told them I felt like my life was ending. The physicians assistant in the ER dismissed me as a panic attack, even tho I’ve had anxiety my entire life and I have never felt close to way I did that night. My experience left me completely traumatized. I struggled to sleep for months afterward, terrified that I would wake up the same way.

Zoloft,Depression,"I have been taking Zoloft for several months. I have IBS which flares up when I'm anxious, and Zoloft really helps with that. It has very few side effects and I feel more like myself when I'm taking Zoloft. I do have one small complaint: when I miss a few consecutive doses I tend to get dizzy. But that's it! Other than that, I have no issues with Zoloft. It's very subtle, and it certainly has improved my mood.",9,"June 23, 2020",110
Zoloft,Depression,"I started taking zoloft after 8 months of post concussion syndrome symptoms.
My anxiety and very low mood were affecting every aspect of my life. I was suicidal.
I started with 50mg for the first month.
Only side effects for me was a bit of nausea the first week and a lack of appetite. 
By week 4 we went up to 100mg and everything has improved significantly!
I can separate emotions from facts which I couldn't do before. The people I thought were ""against me"" don't seem to bother me whatsoever now.
I've gotten my life back. I have energy and an optimistic attitude. My friends and family have  noticed in big ways. It's been a life changed for me.
The only thing I would say are side effects
Low libido
Shortened Sleep. I usually wake up in the middle of the night now.",10,"June 8, 2020",158

Zoloft,Depression,"I started taking sertraline around 5 weeks ago today (25mg). The first few days were fine, I only had a bad stomach for a day or so. However at around week 2 I felt awful, was having extreme suicidal thoughts. I carried on taking the medication as I know it gets a lot worse before it gets better. At 5 weeks now, I have increased my dose to 35.7mg and I feel pretty good. Haven’t had any side affects from increasing the dose slightly just yet.

Week 3, Zoloft increase to 100 mg with 50 mg of Seroquel for sleeping.  We were wondered  if Zoloft making everything worst, but we hung in there.  So glad we did; by week 4 seem like everything reach an equilibrium point; it was like - my gosh what is happening...the depression, anxiety, compulsive  behavior went from a 10 to a 3.  He was able to control & process thoughts, listen to advice, paused more to think things through before his responses, in general very talkative about everything.  Something totally wonderful happened the 4th week and continues to this day.  He is now receptive to knowing the Zoloft medication has pulled him thru a very dark place and now voluntarily open to continue therapy.  For us the Zoloft medication is working.  Yes, it did take time & a lot of patience to see the results.",10,"March 1, 2020",107
Zoloft,Depression,"Been on this med for about a year.
100 mg is the best dosage for me. Really does help depression, but doesn't take away normal grief. When you're happy , but I find that on it, you're really happy and calm, when taking your pills daily and not skipping doses.
I found that combining with high quality magnesium also really helps my mood.
The combination is great. Magnesium alone did nothing.",8,"February 29, 2020",80
Zoloft,Depression,"Starting zoloft again at a dose of 25 MG today. I was on it a couple months ago at a starting dose of 50 MG. I didn't have many symptoms the first time around for two weeks. Week third, probably when it build up in my system, I experienced a continuous migraine along with high pitched ringing in my ears. I was also very constipated, bloated and had dry mouth and was very fatigued throughout that third week. I also lost my appetite and couldn't reach an orgasm. I was very uncomfortable and emotionally unstable during that whole third week. I stopped taking it and all symptoms ceased within 72 hrs. I saw my doctor who put me on wellbutrin. Wellbutrin was awesome, but unfortunately I can't continue taking it during the long term dental work I'm having done.

Zoloft,Depression,"Hi everyone, I am glad to find a place that I can tell my story & maybe get some opinions.
I started taking Zoloft when my husband of 53 years passed, that was 3 years ago.
I had the doctor give me instructions on weaning from it in November. So now it has been 8 days off. I did not have any side effects until today. After I got home from church I just broke out in tears & I am not a crier.
Is it normal to get this effect after 8 days off?  I really would like to stay off the med.

Zoloft,Depression,Increased anxiety dramatically the first few days I took it - to the point I thought I would have a panic attack while I was driving. This levelled off but after every morning dose it would increase my anxiety a bit. Helped with depression I think but unfortunately after a month I started developing sexual side effects and had to cease.,6,"February 19, 2020",27
Zoloft,Depression,"Day 18 on Zoloft started with 50mg increased to 75mg after day 7.   Day 11-15 were terrible days, I felt a lot of anxiety mixed with crying,  lost of appetite and I experienced panic attacks in the early mornings three days in a row (I’ve never once had that issue before).  My physician added 10mg of Buspirone twice a day to help fight those battles and it helped.   Today was a beautiful day — I don’t remember a signal thought holding me back, I felt balanced.

Zoloft,Depression,"This drug saved my life. I started having chronic anxiety and depression very suddenly, and insomnia. I am so thankful for the positive and encouraging reviews on websites like this, because they helped me push through this difficult time, and I hope to do the same for someone else. I agree with many other reviews that it does get worse before it gets better. My anxiety increased at first, I think out of desperation for each day to finally be the day I would feel normal again. But it takes time and patience, and there will be ups and downs. I started seeing improvement around 4 weeks, but took a dive again around week 5 before increasing my dosage. Now I am at about week 7-8 and I would say 90% myself again. I highly recommend doing therapy too, and Xanax has helped curb the increased anxiety while my body adapts. Side effects are minimal, just nausea if I don’t take it with food. Zoloft helped me get my mind back under control and enjoy life again!",10,"February 10, 2020",139
Zoloft,Depression,"2 mths ago I was desperately going through these pages to find something positive about sertraline My had mother died and my daughter, 3 weeks after, went into treatment for 6 weeks for anorexia.

I had most hours of feeling 'ok' but I was frustrated that I was still feeling that adrenalin and anxiety.  By week 5 I was still frustrated by feelings of anxiety.  
Then everything lifted. I promise you will feel better. I absolutely promise. Stick with it. But do the work too! Go out! Exercise! Eat well! (I had no appetite!) Don't watch the news.

Zoloft,Depression,"Thank you all for sharing your experiences. I was on Zoloft 10 years ago ( back in 2009), for 6-7 months only, took only a dose 50mg (started with 25mg) per day for mild depression ( or rather bad moods).  It worked well for me and had no side effects, maybe I  was drinking more water only (dry mouth feeling). I felt very happy - my mood was up , even maybe a little too high ( my friends noticed that as well), but I felt happier, also I became very brave :-) started to tell people things i would usually be afraid to do before.  So my doctor smiled at me and said - congratulations , you are healthy now!  So after 6 months I discontinued ( slowly dosage down), as I felt totally fine. I would love to take again this medicine, but I am very sad to read the reviews and wonder that they have changed the formula of Zoloft and side effects have gone worst  :-(..is this is true? Why would they do that? Anyone could share their experience old zoloft and recent formula zoloft effects? Thanks",8,"February 3, 2020",60

I was loud and obnoxious. My parents actually begged my psychiatrist to take me off of it.

Got a new job; relief. 25mg for a few weeks felt a bit better, but couldn't tell if it was from Zoloft or from life changes and was still feeling a bit empty. Upped to 50mg. It's only been 3 weeks but I feel better+better. It's kinda subtle so far but I feel myself smiling more. Nearly no side effects except major CONSTIPATION. Pharmacist told me meds can cause this. Laxatives are barely working, will try daily Metamucil. Assuming I can get my system back to normal, I think it's worth it. I'm not shaky, drowsy, etc. And I feel better.",9,"January 18, 2020",54

Zoloft,Depression,"Hello,

I have been taking Sertraline for almost two months and I give it 10 out of 10, I feel amazing! In addition to taking the medication, I created my own healing plan: drink water, 8 hour sleep, cognitive behaviour therapy, cut off alcohol, caffeine and sugar, eat vegetables, fish, fruits and nuts, exercise 3 times a week, take vitamin D, B12, magnesium, spend time with friends and family, enjoy the sun, do something fun, meditate and do yoga (try these apps: Calm and Headspace). There is also a free app called Flow which help you to treat depression, have a reiki session  and let go what is not making you happy (job, relationships, addiction), etc.

Medication is great but you need to look at other aspects of your life as well to heal :-)",10,"January 14, 2020",222

However this time I experienced every side effect in the book, dizziness, drowsiness, hot flashes, nervousness, shaking, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea. Most importantly, my mental state declined immensely. I felt 100x worse on the pill than before taking it. I had uncontrollable crying, anxiety attacks and feelings of hopelessness. I really scared myself and I felt that I was never going to get better. And this was only after 4 days of being on the medication and I was at my lowest point I ever have been. This was not the right medication for me.",3,"January 9, 2020",43
Zoloft,Depression,"I've only been taking Zoloft for about a week, so I haven't gotten to feel the full effects... but I will say when I introduced Zoloft to my body the first day, I had serious side effects. Insomnia, anxiety when I closed my eyes, strange thoughts (non dangerous), dizzy. I felt super exhausted and tired but energetic at the same time. Didn't sleep entire night. The next few days I wake up periodically to my limbs twitching like crazy, I have bruxism (grinding of teeth) and sometimes I wake up by jumping upright or throwing myself around in bed. My left pupil is more dilated than my right. I will say, aside from side effects - everyone around me has noticed I am much more calm lately. I am taking it for  OCD, depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. I do get random anxiety at night due to side effects, haven't felt depressed at all in a week. I hope the side effects subside because my sleep is atrocious, and bruxism causes migraines.",8,"January 8, 2020",24
Zoloft,Depression,"This is a very irresponsible website in that you do not instruct the reviewers to state the AMOUNT of Zoloft they take. Without knowing the amount the reviewers are taking, it just amounts to a bunch of worthless babble. It is of no use to anyone.",7,"December 22, 2019",79
Zoloft,Depression,"I was put on Zoloft a month ago. I'd gone to my doctor after a recent breakup and mentioned I had really bad anxiety attacks throughout my last relationship as he'd cheated on me and it was an emotional traumatising. My doctor prescribed me with Zoloft. 
Within a week I was having active suicidal thoughts, I went back to the doctors and said something felt wrong. They said I should let the antidepressants settle in over a six week period and it would be all fine.
Taking this advice I stayed on it - then a few days later  I tried to overdose and was hospitalised. The psychiatrists were so shocked I'd been prescribed Zoloft and said doctors are often too quick to medicate. 
It was the scariest experience of my life, and I'd warn anyone else who is prescribed this to really think about it. Now instead of working through the emotions of a break up I was working through the pain of a mental illness bought on by antidepressants.",2,"December 20, 2019",40
Zoloft,Depression,"It made me feel a little better- it lifted the sadness that I feel all the time but only slightly. I still feel the depression, and it has made my positive emotions feel weaker, almost like the things that made me happy aren’t as powerful anymore. My OCD has worsened and the (very) slight improvement in mood is outweighed by the negatives I’ve experienced. 

Overall, my anxiety is less and I feel less fragile. As time goes on this effect is becoming less strong, but the side effects remain. I am going to talk to my doctor about switching, it’s been 6 weeks with little improvement.",4,"December 18, 2019",17
Zoloft,Depression,"I been on Zoloft for 9 years. Side effects are different every time. I started taking these meds for panic disorder. Then had PPD after my 2nd child. So took them again.  My starting dose was  at 100mg and got  down to 50mg, and now at 175mg. I think depression is worse for me than anxiety. Also not being familiar with all the horrible side effects of depression makes it scary. But being afraid of depression only brings in anxiety with it. Anxiety and depression together is the worst! So I try not to let it freak me out. I've been extremely sleepy during the day ever since I went up to 175mg. It's been like 3 months. I missed my 11am dosage and started feeling lots of anxiety so I took it at 8:30pm. Now I'm wondering if it will help me sleep at night and not be so tired during the day? Also worried the half life of the meds will be during the day and I'll feel like poo. Anyone have experience with switching from morning to night?",10,"December 15, 2019",27
Zoloft,Depression,"I started on Zoloft exactly 3 months ago. 25mg for two days, then 50mg for two days, then 75, then 100. I noticed a change immediately, likely due to placebo. My mood levelled out pretty quick once I hit 100 to a neutral place without the low low days. At 3 weeks I was scheduled to go up to 150mg (and did) and stayed on that dose for a month. Low mood crept back in gradually and then several days in a row. 2 weeks ago, I was upped to 200mg and at this point I am still waiting for it to really take effect. My doctor did mention it could take around 2 weeks.

I’m a supervisor and it’s affecting my job duties. I feel like my critical thinking is gone. I’m going to be weaning myself off it because it’s not  good for my lifestyle. I’m going to try my best to be more fit and take better care of my home and pay more attention to what I have. I’ve come so far in life to not be able to appreciate it. I need the old me back.

I had to stop taking the medication, which I had zero negative side effects while on, because of COVID and insurance issues.

Spironolactone,Acne, A few months after stopping birth control (was on for over ten years) my skin took a total turn for the worse and broke out like crazy. I eventually asked my doctor to try spironolactone. She put me on 50mg. After a month it was increased to 100. Between one and two months later we increased to 150 and now my acne is finally under control. Do not give up. I’m now trying to get rid of the hyperpigmentation from all of the acne. I do still get pimples but at any one time I’ll have between 0 and 3 pimples. During the worst part of my acne I’d have between five and fifteen. So I’m very happy. I did have headaches for the first few weeks but they went away and they weren’t terrible to begin with. I also had a horrible hangover from just beer likely due to being dehydrated more than usual from the spironolactone. I’ve also experienced lighter body hair and a LOT less oil in my hair and on my skin. So thankful for this medication.”,8,"December 16, 2020",0
Spironolactone,Acne," I went on 150mg of Spironolactone almost 2 years ago for hormonal cystic acne and my skin has been nearly perfect since. I get the occasional cyst or two during that time of the month but overall my skin is always clear and the texture has improved a lot. 
In the beginning my skin purged a bit but cleared up by the 5th month. I reduced dosage to 100mg about 6 months ago and my skin is still looking good. One downside of this drug is the brain fog, once I noticed it I started writing reminder notes about everything so I don't forget. 
I will have to stop taking soon since I want to start a family so it will be interesting to see if the acne comes back (unfortunately it probably will).

Thought it worked initially but then stopped. I would really make sure you are willing to take risks with this before starting. Dread shed occurs in beginning and when you stop. Exhaust other measures like vit c iron l lysine b12 selenium. Get your ferritin checked.”",1,"December 2, 2020",2
Spironolactone,Hirsutism," I've been on spironolactone for many, many years, 100mg.  I find it doesn't work anymore at diminishing my facial hair.”",3,"November 16, 2020",2
Spironolactone,Hirsutism, So I have been taking spironolactone for a little over two weeks and I am actually surprised at how fast it works for my facial hair. I have already notice my hair not coming in as thick or fast. Hopefully it’s not all in my head. We will see.”,9,"November 16, 2020",2
Spironolactone,Acne," I was on spiro for several years. It helped but didn't completely clear my skin. I still had cystic nodules that were painful and scarred. A new dermatologist upped my dose to 200mg/day. I'm 5'5"" and 115lbs. The side effects were bad before, I always had to pee in the middle of the night, but they were significantly worse with the higher dose. I couldn't remember anything. The brain fog was unbelievable. I wasn't on any other medications, so I knew it was the spiro. I decided to stop taking the medication in order to return to graduate school (needed a sharp brain for that). My acne is 100% back but at least I can sleep through the night and remember what I've read.”",8,"November 3, 2020",8
Spironolactone,Hirsutism," I have PCOS and have suffered from coarse facial and body hair for years. I recently started noticing male-pattern baldness around my temples and knew this was a hormonal problem, as I was tested for high testosterone. 

I started noticing results within days of taking the spironolactone, way sooner than I thought I would. Within a week I was only having to shave my face every other day rather rather than every day, then every three days. My hairline has stopped receding and is slowly growing back. It's only been three weeks and I'm already so happy with the results.

I have only had minor side effects. The only one that bothers me at all is breast tenderness. I had some hot flashes the first week but they went away quickly. Sometimes I'm a little nauseous or headachy, but only if I don't drink enough water. Since this is a diuretic, you need to stay on top of your water consumption and try to drink as much as you can every day.”",9,"October 5, 2020",8
Spironolactone,Acne," I was put on Spiro for acne. My face was the WORST the first 2-3 months after starting on it. My face had never had that many pimples/ redness on it. However, I decided to stick it out. After 7-8 months on Spiro, my face is completely clear! I almost never get any pimples anymore and my face feels soft and smooth!”",10,"September 18, 2020",17
Spironolactone,Acne,"			 On spironolactone for PCOS and even at the lowest dosage, I developed mild anxiety. My nature of work requires that I maintain a collective presence at all times therefore I ended discontinuing treatment. I could not handle the side effects.”",2,"September 9, 2020",4
Spironolactone,Acne," It’s my 5th day on this medicine (spironolactone 100mg) and today I’m pretty sure I had a panic attack. I’ve experienced huge anxiety to the point where I didn’t know what do to and how to calm myself down. I’d describe it like overwhelming feeling. I rarely ever get anxiety or stressed, so I’m pretty sure that Spirolactone was what caused it because I’ve never ever felt something similar to this. My heart was beating in a weird way, I felt like someone is sitting on my chest. Please think twice before taking this, it’s really strong ”",1,"September 6, 2020",11
Spironolactone,Acne," I was on spirolactone when I was about 14, and going through puberty which brought some unfortunate acne. My skin cleared and I got off of it up until 2 and a half weeks ago when my dermatologist put me back on it at 50mg. I started dealing with hormonal acne that was making me self conscious. My skin purged for 2 weeks and literally at the 2 week mark, bam, my skin cleared up so fast. Everyone is different but please stick with it because it will get better and you can feel confident about your skin again.”",10,"September 5, 2020",11
Spironolactone,Acne, This medication spironolactone is amazing for hormonal acne.   Stick with it- first three months my skin was worse.  Especially around my lips.  Gradually got better starting month 4.    But 6 months in my skin is amazing.  Only side  affect is less body hair.   I did have to pee extra the first couple months.  Now I don’t notice any side affects except less body hair which I love.”,10,"September 4, 2020",10
Spironolactone,Acne," I asked my doctor for a prescription after reading positive things on an acne message board. I always thought my acne was hormonal, but the birth control Pill never worked for me. I started breaking out  when I was about 18  and tried everything to no avail. Fast forward 15 years, prescribed Spironolactone 25 mg moved up to 50 mg right away, noticed a break out  after 3 months and increased to 100mg and have stayed with that dose for about 8 months now. It's been exactly a year and my skin looks incredible. I'm just so thankful for this and wish I would have heard about this before.  I haven't really had any side effects, in the beginning a little drowsy at times, but no issue with that anymore. I think this is great for hormonal acne and if you think its your hormones, definitely give this a try.”",10,"September 3, 2020",6
Spironolactone,Acne," I have struggled with severe acne all over my back and chin/ jawline areas and PCOS, when I started taking this medication it really helped with my acne. However there would be times after standing up after eating or getting out of bed I would fall over from being so light headed and dizzy. Also my anxiety had sky rocketed, I have dealt with minor anxiety in the past but after being on this medication it is now so bad. But at least my acne is clearing up!”",3,"August 26, 2020",7
Spironolactone,Acne, If you suffer from anxiety or depression avoid this medication even at a low dose it sent my anxiety through the roof resulting in really dark thoughts. I’ll take bad skin over my mental health any day.”,1,"August 11, 2020",17
Spironolactone,High Blood Pressure, Be careful with spironolactone! Aside from other side effects this drug can cause fever and chills - aka  drug fever” After taking it for a few days I woke up one morning with shaking chills and fever-which could easily be mistaken for an infection. Felt god-awful and could barely get out of bed. I had the same reaction years ago to aldomet-I had no idea the two drugs were related until I asked the pharmacist.”,1,"August 2, 2020",8
Spironolactone,Alopecia," I had a devastating bout of hair shedding over the last month from an unknown cause. Doctor diagnosed it as  telogen effluvium. A week later, my hair started falling out even faster. Not sure if it’s a good medication for hair loss form an unknown cause.”",3,"July 27, 2020",12
Spironolactone,Primary Hyperaldosteronism, After being diagnosed with hypertension after the birth of our youngest daughter my doctor quickly realized none of the drugs he tried to prescribe me to control my bp seemed to work. My bp ranged anywhere from 170/90- 215/110 and as a 39 year old female he could not figure out why this would happen to me. My primary care sent me to a cardiologist who tested everything under the sun and found nothing. So by chance he then sent me to an endocrinologist and upon receiving the results of the excessive testing they ran I was found to have primary hyperaldosteronism. I was placed on spironolactone and within 2 weeks my bp went down quite a bit. Over the next  6 weeks the spironolactone was titrated up to 50mg in the morning and 50mg at night. My BP is now 115/75 and my potassium is normal. My one side effect is prolonged menstruation which started once my dose was raised. This medication is truly a life saver ”,9,"June 14, 2020",9
Spironolactone,Alopecia," I read all these reviews before taking spironolactone & I was nervous about side effects, but I'm so glad I started. 50mg/day taken before bed, 23 yrs old. I'm two weeks in, and the first couple days I had really bad dehydration, lightheadedness, fatigue, little nausea. Once I started drinking water I felt better, & back to normal in 48 hours. Peeing every half hour, but that got better as well. Now, my appetite has slightly decreased & I can't eat a lot at once without feeling nauseous. Occasional diarrhea--balance your fiber and drink a lot of water! But it's worth it because I have inch-long hairs growing on on my scalp!!! After two days, my hair felt thicker & didn't shed as much. My face is slightly less oily & my breasts are slightly bigger, which is a good thing for me.”",9,"June 13, 2020",40
Spironolactone,Alopecia," I'm quite ambivalent about Spironolactone. I started taking it in October 2019 for alopecia and at 100mg it does it's job. My hair loss stopped and a lot of what I lost grew back. However, since I went up to 100mg I started having panic attacks and general anxiety, which I didn't experience before. When I lowered the dose to 50mg the anxiety disappeared, but so did my hair, so I stayed on 100mg. I also have to watch my potassium intake, if I eat too much of it I get arrhythmia. I still recommend to try it if you suffer under hair loss and if nothing else worked for you. It is a life long commitment though.”",7,"June 12, 2020",19
Spironolactone,Acne, I was prescribed Spironolactone 50 mg to treat acne. Two months later my cystic acne improved but my hair started falling out really bad. I have never had a problem with hair loss before. My doctor reassured me that Spironolactone doesn't cause hair loss and recommended to continue the treatment. I was happy with clearer skin and kept taking the medication hoping that the hair loss will stop but it didn't. After six months of treatment I lost a substantial amount of my hair volume and decided to stop Spironolactone. I didn't have any underlying conditions and haven't had any traumatizing life events that would cause hair loss. Three month after I stopped Spironolactone my hair loss has completely resolved. Half a year later I decided to try Spironolactone again as my acne came back. Surely enough my hair started shedding really bad after one or two weeks of taking this medication. I am very disappointed that this medication did more harm than good.”,2,"June 10, 2020",23
Spironolactone,Hirsutism," I've been on 100mg for about 3 months now.

 I haven't had any negative side effects. I rarely get that fuzzy feeling, like when you have low blood sugar; only if I'm dehydrated or get up fast. I already drank a lot of water, so haven't noticed a change in my water intake or need to use the bathroom.

Buuuuut I also haven't seen any benefits yet! My body hair is the same, facial hair is the same, skin the same.

Not sure if I'm going to go on 200mg or go off of it. I'll update at a later date with anything new.”",1,"May 30, 2020",26
Spironolactone,High Blood Pressure," Since I’ve started this drug... I hardly need to pee very small amounts 
I’ve tried drinking more, over 2.5 litres. Doesn’t seem to make any difference

Spironolactone,Hirsutism," I am 25, 5ft4 and weigh 15stone. I have PCOS and do the excess hair growth with all things combined has just been awful. My last resort was Spironolactone. The first week or so it definitely made me dizzy, especially when getting up etc. I’ve been on this tablet for 3 and a half months now and I can 100% see a difference. My once black facial hair is almost blonde now. I am on an 800cal diet and have lost 3 stone since starting this (was 17stone). I believe the weight loss and the medication is helping this. I am really happy to be honest.”",9,"April 29, 2020",35
Spironolactone,High Blood Pressure," been taking spirolactone for 10 years or more, kept my BP levels around 122/77 for years. Side effects was dry mouth, if I didn't drink enough water, urination often at night, swelling of the chest, was mild, soreness, mild.  did lower  testosterone , only notice that on paper, as I didn't feel any different. Now  the effectiveness is waring down. may have to get a higher dose.  148/94 don't like that.”",8,"April 10, 2020",13
Spironolactone,Acne," I was on spiro for over 2 years. A few months ago I started getting my pre-prescription level of cystic hormonal acne all over my chin. It hasn’t gotten any better, and I was already on the maximum dosage. I’m so devastated because this worked SO well for me for such a long time - suddenly to stop. I will say I got terrible terrible nightmares (a common side effect for blood pressure medications) so I took a majority of my dosage in the mornings instead of before bed and that improved my sleep quality significantly. I also peed a lot. A lot a lot. An annoying but not threatening side effect.”",7,"April 7, 2020",7
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," Awful. Just awful for me. I have a mental illness called borderline personality disorder which causes me to have extremely poor mood regulation and intense bouts of anger to the point of boiling rage. The spironolactone exacerbated this tenfold until I was blowing up at people every single day over the dumbest little things. It got to the point where I almost had to go back inpatient for my mental problems. It was absolute nightmare for the couple weeks that I took it, and if you have any mental health diagnoses, I would urge you to think twice about spirolactone, or at least monitor yourself and your moods verrrry carefully. Depression also got a little worse. Oh, and I guess only two weeks of taking it isn’t long enough to tell if it worked for hirsutism and my hormonal acne, but so far, it didn’t do much.”",1,"April 3, 2020",16
Spironolactone,  Acne," Started in July 2019 taking 50 mg. After 3 months (Oct 2019) switched to 100 mg per day. I had a breakout each time. Which lasted a few weeks. It definitely got worse before better. After 4 months on 100mg ( Feb 2020). I switched to 150 mg per day (100 in am and 50 at night)
Had a little breakout from increasing dosage. Overall my skin is far less oily and I haven't had a painful cyst in months. I do get a few breakouts here but I think my body is still adjusting to the medication. 

I have not had a single migraine since I started the medication (use to get multiple a month around ovulation and period and would have to take Imatrex)

I use benzoyl peroxide wash in the morning ( every couple days I use Cerave SA renewing cleanser for exfoliation) followed by Cetaphil lotion and Elta MD sunscreen.
At night I wash with Neutrogena gentle hydrating cleanser followed by Cetaphil lotion. Right before bed I apply Trentinoin .025 gel.”",10,"March 9, 2020",26
Spironolactone,  Alopecia," I actually can’t believe it’s taken me I don’t know how many years to find this medication! 
Long story short .... 5 years of non stop hair loss and thinning .... 4 years on minoxidil ..... 10k spent on PRP and mesotherpy and nothing was working for longer than a week or two .... I would call it a good hair week.
Currently I am 28 years old and single because of how low I felt about myself and how the hair loss affected my mental health.
After going to see my maybe 5th private dermo she recommended trying spirolactone as a last resort as I had actually tried everything!!!
I held 0 hope BUT 5 months in my parting has got 1.5mm thicker, thicker hair strands and the last 4 weeks I have had minimal hair shedding.
I don’t want to get to excited as it might just be a ‘good hair month’ but if this continues I can honestly say this drug has changed my life and my mental health :)”",8,"March 8, 2020",86

Spironolactone,  Acne," I originally made an appointment with my dermatologist with the sole purpose of getting put on Accutane. However, I left in tears that day when I found out my insurance does not cover it and its just too expensive out of pocket. My dermatologist prescribed me Spironolactone and I was iffy about it. I came home and read people's reviews for it and its use with acne and honestly was scared to death due to everyone posting that their skin got worse for a while. I tried it though. Thank goodness! My skin cleared up within 2 weeks. I am so very thankful. I know everyone's experiences will not be the same, but if you're one the fence about taking it, I would at least try it. I almost didn't and I was becoming so self conscious about my skin that I was becoming depressed. It has been a game changer for me!”",10,"February 28, 2020",52
Spironolactone,  Acne, Was prescribed for hormonal acne a few months ago. I would get cystic acne so bad on my chin I was receiving steroid shots monthly. My doctor finally switched me to spironolactone  150mg daily and I couldn't be happier with the results my acne is about 99% cleared up my menstrual cycles  are rare and very light when they do occur. I notice no side effects and I'm loving my freedom from acne”,9,"February 28, 2020",19
Spironolactone,  Acne," Finally stopped taking this. had been experiencing terrible side effects for 6 months. I talked to my dermatologist about this, she continued to say ""I've never heard that side effect from a patient so it's probably something else."" Ridiculous anecdotal evidence especially because all of the symptoms I experienced were listed for the med. I have stopped seeing this doctor. Med caused EXTREME fatigue, weakness, there were many times when all I could do was lay on the couch, It was miserable to get through all the days at work. Huge stomach issues, dizziness, vision  disturbances, and sleep problems. Absolutely no sex drive and huge mood disturbances. I stayed on it for so long because it was effective and improved my acne 100%, it was a hard choice to stop but I realized my overall health and well being is WAY more important than how my skin looks. Also an important lesson I learned is always trust your body and doctors are not always right.”",1,"February 27, 2020",48
Spironolactone,  Acne," I was put on it for  hormonal acne” which is what my derm referred to it as. I only had big bumps around my mouth/chin, around my hair line, and my temples. It was nothing severe but definitely noticeable. She put me on 50 mg spironolactone a day and after 3 months there was only slight difference. She then decided to put me a dose of 100 mg a day and it worked like a charm. My skin purged SO bad for about 6 weeks and then it started clearing up. It made me extremely thirsty and made me lose my appetite because it sort of made me nauseous. But over all, it works great in my opinion”",8,"February 22, 2020",19
Spironolactone,Acne,"			 My anti-aging doctor started me on spironolactone in January and my health declined from the start of it. I didn’t put two and two together until last week and stopped the medicine immediately. Sure enough I’m feeling better already. I had nausea, worse headaches than I usually have, numbness, tingling, stomach cramps, leg pain, arm pain and the list goes on. It had to be the medicine, I went to urgent care once in the 6 week time period and the ER twice. I was told it was migraines. I knew it was something different. I know what my migraines feel like. This medicine was dangerous. I don’t care how safe my doctor says it is.”",2,"February 21, 2020",4
Spironolactone,  High Blood Pressure," I have been taking 50mg of Spironolactone (together with 2x50mg Loxen) for 12 days. Effects will certainly still evolve, but in my case it lowers BP, makes me lose water, raises my low potassium, might help against my hirsutism (too early to tell), lowers my appetite and eliminates PMS. 

I have tried 8 other common BP meds before with side effects like cough, tinnitus, heart palpitations, fatigue and raised BP, and I started out with low potassium, fluid retention and hirsutism. Seems like a very good fit if you are in a similar situation..”",9,"February 18, 2020",14

Spironolactone,  Acne," Have been on this medication for a little over a month - started at 50 mg. About a week ago, my derm bumped up my dosage to 100 mg. Days later, acne was worse than when I started, after reading, I see skin purging is common ... thank goodness. I do not want to give up so quickly, but was getting very discouraged. For those of you who have dealt with the purging and now into the light at the end of the tunnel, did you use anything or do anything to help at least calm the purging process?

Thank you! :)”",,"February 11, 2020",42
Spironolactone,  Acne," I had severe cystic acne on my chin. It was all very painful and red skin. I went to derm she prescribed Spirolactone  50mg dose for 3 months. I took that 3 months but no much difference. At the second visit she increased the dose to 100 mg for another 3 months. it has been 2 months now, my skin is all cleared up like my dream.

Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," I started Spironolactone 3 weeks ago at 100 mg. These past weeks I have experienced nausea, tiredness, headaches, and dizziness. 2 days ago I actually fainted and fractured my jaw by smashing it on a counter I fell on when fainting. I am now undergoing surgery for my jaw and having teeth removed. I have never experienced this before. My blood pressure has gone from 120/85 to 85/55 in the past 2 days.

I have spent thousands on Lazer, electrolysis, medicines and it’s worse now more than ever. Just started on Spironolactone  (1 month) and it’s worse instead of better. I was on 1000mg of metformin but I thought this drug would be better. I have other autoimmune illnesses that I take meds for. I was so hoping this would help! I’m so disappointed. The mood swings and more hair growth is awful. I hate to give up only after one month but I don’t think it’s going to work for me.”",1,"February 8, 2020",12
Spironolactone,  Acne," I was on this medicine for about 4 months, but I kind of have mixed opinions about it. Some days I loved this and didn’t know what life was like before it, other days I was breaking out and felt like it wasn’t working. I just recently came off of this medicine, since I started taking it it’s been making me feel sick all the time, I was always dizzy and nausea with severe headaches. Despite this all, I do have to say I can see a complete change in my skin since I stopped taking it, I’ve been breaking out more now than I have the whole time I was taking it. It definitely was keeping my acne at bay.”",8,"February 5, 2020",8
Spironolactone,  Acne," I’ve been on 50mg for 3 months. Before then I had awful cyclic acne and pimples on my cheeks, chin and neck. Like 20 spots at a time. After just a week on spironolactone, I stopped getting new cysts and acne. Since then I’ve only had a couple of zits on my forehead. Now just waiting for the discoloration from old acne to go away. It’s been a miracle for me.  Never had  purge” acne, the breast tenderness/thirst went away in a week, but holy moly, I have lots of gas for the first time in my life. The upside is my kids think it’s hilarious.”",10,"February 5, 2020",17
Spironolactone,  Acne, Update2 (original post 2020-01-12) : ok! So I decided to take the 50 mg once a day. I'm over the tired feeling and feeling sluggish. I just couldn't handle two a day. I'm 3 weeks in on this medication plus my tretinoin cream every night and I am seeing a difference in my skin. My scars and pimples are fading slowly but surely and my face looks amazing with makeup now! I'm so glad I didn't quit taking this. If you feel like it's too much listen to your body and cut back if if you can't handle it. I will update again in a few weeks. Good luck to you Spiro users and hang in there it does take time.”,5,"January 31, 2020",15
Spironolactone,  Acne," I have been taking this medication spironolactone for about 10 months now, 50mg daily, for acne. At first, I thought that it was working. I had many days with completely clear skin, but I’ve realized now that it was just a coincidence. I’m still struggling with acne all over my face and body. I am going to be switching to something else in the near future.”",4,"January 28, 2020",5
Spironolactone,  Acne," 6 months in, I  have a good skin care routine with it and I'm drinking lots of water, yet nothing. I am currently on 125 mg and my skin is just as bad as before. Pretty bummed.”",1,"January 27, 2020",12
Spironolactone,  Acne," UPDATE: Been on the Spiro for 2 weeks now and the side effects are awful! I feel so tired most of the time with absolutely zero energy. I was hoping this medication would be right for me and that I could stick with it but I don't know about that anymore. I am nauseous most of the day and I'm actually supposed to take 50 mg b.i.d (twice daily) but I just can't. So it looks like I will be going on accutane in the near future. I have noticed breast tenderness and they do feel fuller but I can't handle the ""no energy"" part. It works for some people I guess but definitely not for me. I'm sure it takes a while to see results too, like I said, I'm 2 weeks in and my face is worse now than before. Good luck to the rest of you. I hope it works for you.”",2,"January 24, 2020",10
Spironolactone,  Acne," I was on Spiro for 10 months. I probably didn't need to go on it as I would only get cystic pimples around my cycle. My issue was whiteheads and my derm told me Spiro is more for cystic acne but I went on it anyway, desperate. It definitely smoothed and brightened my complexion, but as the doctor said, I still got whiteheads and my skin was never really 100% clear, which is the result I was hoping for. It also made me very tired, dizzy and I had CRAZY mood swings for the whole time I was on it. I was taking 50mg a day and phased myself off of it. I did 25mg for about a month then cut that in half until it was all gone. I was extremely nervous as I heard it can come back once you stop it but I think the phasing out helped. My skin is clear for the most part and I am in a much happier mood all around and have way more energy. Wouldn't recommend unless you really have the right acne for it.”",3,"January 23, 2020",7
Spironolactone,  Acne," I was put on 100 mg  spironolactone for moderate to severe cystic acne nearly 2 years ago. 
I didn't really notice any side effects except extremely inconsistent periods and slightly increased urination. My skin did purge for somewhere between 4 to 6 weeks but after that my acne almost completely cleared, with a few small pimples here and there. After about 9 months, I started getting some cystic pimples but no where near as bad as before.

Currently I would say I almost always have at least 1 (non cystic) pimple, with breakouts and up to 3 cystic around my period. 

It's not perfect, but I'm grateful for spironolactone and the amount it's cleared with minimal side effects (for me) so I would highly recommend people with PCOS related acne give it a go.”",8,"January 20, 2020",10
Spironolactone,  Acne," I was on this medication for about 3 months in hopes to clear up my cystic acne.  I heard about the dreaded purge so was expecting my acne to get worse before it got better, but it just kept getting worse. And worse. And worse.  I took pictures of my face every day during that time, in hopes to compare pictures from week to week to convince myself it was in fact getting better.  I still have those pictures and it was the worst cystic acne I have ever had in my life. I had many large, deep and painful breakouts daily while taking this medication.  Specifically the cystic acne was near my side burns and jaw line.  I even remember going to the pharmacy to pick up my prescription one time and the pharmacist commenting on how bad my acne was and how I would never get rid of the scars. I just kept hoping it would get better but I eventually stopped taking it and the large painful acne went away after a month.”",1,"January 20, 2020",11
Spironolactone,  Acne," After I went off the pill my skin completely broke out along the jawline and cheeks. I then put an IUD in, for contraception purposes, and it seemed to make it even worse. I have been taking Spiro for about 7 months and now I have no pimples whatsoever. I started on 25mg a day, then went up to a dose 50mg after a couple of months and am now on 75mg a day. It did take a while, my jawline cleared up almost immediately but my cheeks took about 5 months. I have also been getting facials with herbal peels and more recently microneedling for the pigmentation from scars. I had absolutely no side effects either.
I am so relieved to have clear skin again although I do worry that I'll have to be on this forever or that it will stop working.”",9,"January 18, 2020",12
Spironolactone,  Acne," After 5 months on this spironolactone medication for acne, my skin is the worst it’s ever been- painful cysts everywhere. Not even makeup can cover. I’m so sad and depressed this didn’t work for me, as I cannot take much for my acne because I am still breastfeeding. The purge was so painful and terrible but I endured it for 5 months hoping to wake up one day to clear skin. Did not work for me. Didn’t experience any of the side effects either.”",1,"January 15, 2020",9
Spironolactone,  Acne, I have been on spironolactone 25 mg 1x a day for 1 week then up to 2x a day for just 4 days now. I have noticed that I've been peeing a little bit more that normal and I am exhausted and I feel nauseated for the most part. I'm going to hang in there and keep taking it unless it gets to the point I can't stand it. My face must already be going through the dreaded purge everyone talks about because I have several cystic pimples closed comedones and painful itchy pustules as well. I am also on tretinoin 0.025 % every night and clindamycin during the day ( which makes my skin very oily so I decided to only use it when skin felt dry. She also gave me a selenium sulfate face wash to use once a day. I will update at once a month has passed to let you all know of any changes. I'm going to hang in there and see if this medicine works for me. I'm hoping and praying it does.”,3,"January 12, 2020",6
Spironolactone,  High Blood Pressure," I was on this medication for a short time for blood pressure, and had noticeable breast growth on one side and increased tenderness on both sides and had to stop taking it because of this, it works very well for helping control my blood pressure but I could not deal with the side effects”",3,"January 10, 2020",18
Spironolactone,  Acne," The thing is, it never fully cleared up my skin. I've been on Spiro for 2 years now, and was still experiencing horrible cystic acne flare ups around my menses. I stopped the medication currently and I'm now breaking out in tons of white heads all over my chin with cystic acne to boot. I would rather have a more permanent solution, and am looking to start Accutane.”",2,"January 8, 2020",1
Spironolactone,  Acne, This is probably gonna be my last review of spirolactone but only because I can’t find any other fantastic things to say that I haven’t already! I have been on spirolactone 100mg daily  for acne for nearly a year now  (started at 25 then gradually increased over the span of 8 months) and I don’t have any acne breakouts any longer. I used to receive some right around my period after 6 months in spirolactone along my jawline but now there’s nothing. Now I’m using exfoliating serums to combat redness and dark spots!  I don’t even experience the frequent urination anymore. Sometimes I do get a bit dizzy if I stand up too quickly but that’s never been a real determining factor to me because it’s so mild. Please stick with it if your symptoms aren’t concerning! This medication saved my confidence!! The purge is worth it! Don’t give up!”,10,"January 8, 2020",14
Spironolactone,  Acne," I’m 29, and taking spiro for acne and alopecia. I’ve had mild to moderate acne my whole life since 13 or 15, and mild hair thinning since 25 that turned more aggressive at 28. I initially started spiro 50mg once a day for 6 months, had initial purge for about 2 months then skin started clearing up slowly. Two months ago, I increased dose to 50mg twice a day and my skin have never been more clear. Have not noticed improvement in my hair yet. I heard it takes at least 6 months at higher dose to notice significant improvement, so I'm still hopeful. Only side effect at higher dose is that it seems to dehydrate me a little, so I make sure i drink a lot of water and use good moisturizing cream.”",9,"January 8, 2020",5
Spironolactone,  Alopecia," spironolactone has been an Absolute miracle drug for my PCOS symptoms. My dose is that  I take one 100mg tablet per dayCramps in my ovary area stopped overnight, acne on face and chest cleared up in a week, and I gained a heap of energy after about a month which has remained with me ever since. My alopecia stopped after about 3 months, and my hair started to grow back. Added bonus: decreased appetite and weight loss - I've lost 10kg this year, of which I would easily attribute 5kg to this medication alone. Only side effect was I fainted once when I first went on it (blood pressure adjustment at the start). I never want to come off this drug, it was completely improved my life for the better.

Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," I’ve been using spirolatone for nearly a year now for facial hair. I started out at 25 mg, I increased to 50 mg and noticed the darkness going away.  Increased to 100 mg and the coarseness has gone away.  Now I’m taking 200 mg and it’s AMAZING!  I’ve gone through Electrolosis, laser, plucking and now waxing.   I was waxing every week, now I can go 2 weeks.  Even the hair on my arm are lighter.  I told my doctor it’s a miracle medication.   I recommend everyone to try...”",10,"December 22, 2019",37
Spironolactone,  Acne," I just started this drug after being on it previously approximately 2 years ago.  I didn't experience any crazy symptoms previously so I was confident it would be a cake walk.  Boy was I wrong!  I am going into day 4 of taking the med and I have been experiencing stomach issues, nausea, mind fogginess, dizziness, and headaches.  The last straw was I almost fainted the other night.  I am not taking this drug anymore.  The short-term issues are bad enough, but I am afraid of long-term issues that may happen if I continue to do so.  Please be careful and listen to your body.”",,"December 18, 2019",8
Spironolactone,  Acne," I had really bad hormonal acne that started in my early 20s. I tried facials, chemical peels, maca powder, fish oil pills & every other ""natural"" remedy you could think of. Nothing worked or made it worse. I was told to stop eating dairy, which I did for 2 years. Started lo-esterin birth control. I also tried benzoyl peroxide creams, retinol creams,etc. Helped but still had rampant upswings of acne right after my period. Went up on the estrogen level of my BC,  had the same issue. At this point, I was willing to do ANYTHING. My PCP suggested one final option before going to the derm & that was spirolactone. I didn't see results until about 2-3 months after taking it. My skin is clear now! My side effects were urinating frequently, nausea and leg cramping. It always helped if I ate something to avoid nausea, and I started drinking A LOT more water which helped with the cramps. Overall, I'm so happy I tried this medication out and am much more confident than I was in the past few years of my life”",9,"December 16, 2019",15
Spironolactone,  High Blood Pressure, I tried spiro 6 months ago lowered my bp to much had to come off. 100grm. Dr wouldn't listen to my side effects. Dry mouth severe cramps and numbness in left of face and left arm and foot. Sore mouth and tongue and so thirsty and itchy scalp and lots of hair falling out. Was put back on lower dose 1/2 of 25grm. Same night numbness started and fingers started to cramp. Washed hair a few days later and loads fell out. Stopped taking after 12 days. Dr not going to be pleased. This is a dangerous drug. Don't know how far numbness goes if ignored”,1,"December 4, 2019",18
Spironolactone,  Acne," On October 30th, 2019 I started Spiro and Yaz. I had started on accutane in 2018 for minimal acne, but in September of 2019, after I started taking Lo Estrin Fe, I broke out worse than I ever did before accutane. Breakouts continued weekly, even after starting Spiro and Yaz,  I broke out on Wednesdays (weird, I know) and then my skin would heal until the next week when I would breakout on Wednesday. As a 18 year old that’s insecure to begin with, this took an immense toll on my self esteem and prevented me from feeling confident. However just when I thought I was going to breakout yesterday (Wednesday Nov, 2019) my acne cleared and I didn’t have typical cystic breakouts covering my jawline, forehead, chin, and mouth. Be patient and wait out the horrible symptoms initially(the first week I was beyond nauseous and sad) but after that it has been smooth sailing. I’m sorry if you’re going through the purge, keep in mind you are still beautiful and everything heals in time!”",10,"December 4, 2019",22
Spironolactone,  Acne, spironolactone is a life saver for acne!! long story short. I was having minor breakouts and my derm put me on doxycycline which did nothing but break me out worse than I ever had for 2 months.  My derm noticed that this was a hormonal reaction so she put me on 25 mg twice a day spiro along with adapalene and clindamycin nightly.  Wow!!! I have been on it for 2 months now and it is seriously helping so much I have seen so much improvement.  I also took myself off doxy awhile ago which my derm approved of.  It is also helping with scarring. derm just moved me up to 50mg twice a day and so far no symptoms except a decreased appetite.    Highly recommend”,9,"December 3, 2019",8
Spironolactone,  Acne," You know it’s really frustrating to see people post reviews of only being on the medication for 2/3 months and already calling it a day because they don’t realise the purge will happen and is a sign that the medication is working. I tried 50mg for 5 months, zilch nothing nada, contemplated going on Accutane but then my dermatologist upped my dose to 75mg and I’m already seeing a difference . You have to be patient , seriously patient. The side effects are also unbearable but bearable”",7,"December 1, 2019",7
Spironolactone,  Acne," Throw in trash. You will thank me. It will clear up your skin but ruin your life. Crazy weight gain even though zero changes to diet and exercise. Brain fog, killed sex drive, zero energy.  For clear skin? Pass. Now I get to lose the 10 pounds I put on in three months on this.  Google weight gain spirolactone and read the threads.

Spironolactone,  Acne," Had I found spironolactone years earlier I would have saved thousands and thousands of dollars on facials, every new acne product at Sephora etc...  In my late thirties I started getting hormonal acne of my chin and neck. It went away for awhile and then got crazy bad in early forties. It sucked so much. Nothing like getting wrinkles and huge zits at same time. Tried everything and then my sister told me about spironolactone. Went to my dermatologist who said yes that is what I should be on and now my hormonal acne is gone. Why it took my sister so long to tell me her secret no idea.  But thank goodness she finally told me.”",10,"November 29, 2019",19
Spironolactone,  Acne," Hello!

I first started experiencing hormonal acne when  I was 22 years old  (28 now) and tried lots of things but finally found spironolactone and found it to be REALLY helpful in clearing my skin...for about a year and a half and then I started getting more and more breakthrough acne.  I had always gotten a zit or two around my period but this was different. I eventually quit taking it because I thought, ""why bother?"".  I tried going the diet and holistic medicine route, but eventually became so ashamed and frustrated that I went back on spiro about 1.5 years ago...now same thing. Randomly out of no where, I have intense breakouts all over again. I am still taking 100mg- never missed a dose. Has anyone else experienced this? Where the drug was working wonderfully and then BOOM just stopped working?”",6,"November 27, 2019",35
Spironolactone,  Acne," Just so everyone knows- your acne will get worse on spironolactone before it gets better, especially if your up your dose fast. I was on spironolactone for 5 years and let me tell you- it was amazing. It made a tremendous difference in my skin and balanced my hormones. Its like birth control 2.0 (although it does not prevent pregnancy of course). 

I highly recommend it to those struggling with hormonal acne, just increase the dose slowly. Spironolactone is a diuretic and your body really needs time to get used to it. You also really have to watch your potassium. Some derms may tell you to increase your spironolactone dose quickly or they may tell you to start out on 50mgs twice daily- but trust me this is not a good idea. It will be hard on your body and hard on your skin for several months. Start on 25mgs twice daily. Stay on this for 3-6 months, then increase to 50mgs twice daily if needed.”",,"November 27, 2019",15
Spironolactone,  Acne," I had acne all over my face, neck, shoulder, chest and back it was getting worst and worst. I started taking  spirolactone 50mg twice daily which I follow for almost 3 months. I self discontinue it because I started having low blood pressure. Only a few days after stopping the med my acne started to come back, which was very depressing. So at the next visit,I  asked her to give the spironolactone in a lower dose 25mg twice daily. After taking it for about a week I started seeing improvement. This time haven't noticed side effects. However, if I start missing doses my acne comes back. I fear when I discontinue to get pregnant what will happen to my acne and worried about the long term side effects. So I will keep using it for now and hopefully some day I won't need it. (Quick note... I don't  have any medical issues except for my acne and am 26y)”",9,"November 27, 2019",7

Spironolactone,  Acne," I have been taking spirolactone for 1.5 months for acne, and my skin has gotten so, so much worse. Like, I went from having small pimples on my cheeks to having a full blown breakout full of pustules, cysts, and these really painful hidden pimples all over my jaw, cheeks, forehead, even my nose!! I have never experienced painful pimples until now! I don’t think I’ll be able to continue on this medication. I know it’s supposed to start being effective in the 3-4 month mark, but there is no way I could wait until then if my skin will be this bad til then. I didn’t think there was supposed to be a purge with his medication, but wow. My poor skin is in terrible condition despite excellent skincare.. I’m so sad.”",,"November 19, 2019",9
Spironolactone,  Acne, I have been on 100mg of Spironolactone for about 6 months now. I was about to give up on this medication and start accutane and so glad I didn't.

I highly recommend giving this medication a try and just remember to be patient.”,10,"November 17, 2019",8
Spironolactone,  Acne," I realize that spirolactone works differently for everyone, and the time frame it takes to work depends on the individual and the severity of acne, but within one month and a half my acne had 75% vanished. Now at two months I've seen a 90-95% clearance of my breakouts. I used to have several breakouts a day so every night I was popping 3-10 pimples. My acne was not cystic (not in the dermis) but I had several painful papules and pustules, and lots of jawline comedones that would erupt into painful pus-filled blemishes. I noticed the jawline clearing up first and within a couple weeks, my cheeks began clearing up, and now I have two old lesions healing on my face from over a week ago. I no longer breakout every single day with painful pimples, and I no longer have to wear lots of makeup to leave my house. In the recent months my diet has been poor and I haven't been working out or drinking enough water, but this medication STILL cleared up my acne in my case.”",10,"November 6, 2019",10

Spironolactone,  Acne," I’ve been on 50 mg spirolactone for 20 days for my pimples. I know it may take months to see results, but here’s an update: 
I don’t have any actual pimples currently, but my entire face is covered (and I mean every centimeter is covered) by small white pustules. Some are like regular white heads while others are deeply set in and impossible to pop. They’re all over my face but especially dense around my jawline and cheeks (which have always been my problem areas)
I have dryness which is both flaking and also chapped red splotches that I’m sure will go away over time. While my face is dry, it still gets oily by the end of the day so I think I might need to up the dosage. I know it’s supposed to make you pee a lot, but I haven’t noticed so much. Maybe a little more than usual, but nothing drastic. 
I’ve had acne for 11 years, tried everything including accutane . I have moderate-severe hormonal acne and sometimes cystic acne, but birth control severely affects my mood so I can’t be on it.”",7,"November 4, 2019",7

Spironolactone,  Alopecia," I hit pre-menopause and my formerly thick head of hair literally started falling out in clumps. Spiro arrested the loss and my hair regrew over a year+ time and then I tried to go off of Spiro a couple of years later as I am on BHRT and stable now. 
Big mistake, after I tapered off exactly 3 months later my hair started coming out at a shocking rate. It is awful, I am sick to my stomach every time I wash my hair I pick up a massive fist sized hair ball. I can just touch my head and hair comes out, it is everywhere, all over the house, my clothes... I am back on Spiro (200mg) and praying every day for the loss to slow. I have lost nearly half my hair volume in 4 weeks :-( I wanted to post as a warning for anyone who stops Spiro...try slowly reducing over a year and in increments, give it a good 3 months before assuming you are ok. I should have done this more gradually to avoid now losing so much hair.”",10,"November 1, 2019",62
Spironolactone,  Acne," This spirolactone is the only thing that has worked for my skin (acne) so far. I had cystic acne that would leave scarring for months and had tried 2 rounds of antibiotics, accutane and many different topicals. However, I think my acne was due to a hormonal imbalance so after the accutane and antibiotics, the acne would come right back. I was at my wits end and decided to ask my dermatologist about spironolactone. I have been on 100mg per day since end of March so about 7 months and my skin has been the best in years. I barely get any breakouts, if I do its only a small zit. I also started seeing results within the first month and only side effects are having to drink more water and go to the bathroom more but its not that bad.”",9,"October 24, 2019",10

Spironolactone,  Acne," Hello acne community, 

Two months ago, I was just starting this medication.  I was reading through all of these reviews feeling very optimistic about the progress my skin was going to make.  

I am here to just share my story to warn.  After the first two weeks on spironolactone my skin took a horrible turn, and I looked worse than I ever had.  I kept waiting it out thinking it was just the purging period even though this medication wasn't supposed to cause purging.  Two months after the start of this medication I could not continue with it.  I had lost all hope.  I went off of the medication and within the first day I started to feel and look better.  

If it doesn't feel right talk to your Dr.  I wish I had sooner.”",1,"October 17, 2019",10
Spironolactone,  Alopecia," Been on spironolactone 100mg and a year ago increased to 200mg. Since then I notice little  skin lesions, they're not itchy just red. I've seen a few doctors and my dermatologist who say it's eczema and gave me a steroid cream. Start of this year I reduced my dose of spirolactone from 200mg to 100mg then 50mg and my hair thinned unfortunately but I noticed my lesions fading. I increased my dose back to 200mg and lesions are back , I feel the spiro is the cause. If I reduce spiro my hair thins if I don't I'm getting a rash. Recently I've started the utoimmune protocol (AIP) diet  as I've heard can help with autoimmune diseases, so no dairy, wheat, sugar and nightshades then I'll go onto Paleo diet. If anyone else has had the issue with spirolactone and rashes, please comment, if you have gone onto a diet that has improved symptoms , did you stop spiro soon as you started the diet? or continue to take them until improvements were seen from the diet then stop?”",6,"October 17, 2019",18
Spironolactone,  Acne," I am a 41. Have struggled with acne since I was a teen.  Last year (40th) I decided to have a last ditch attempt at sorting out my acne. I asked my GP to refer me to a dermatologist. I paid to go privately to speed up the process. I was prescribed 100mg Spironolactone twice daily. My expectations were low. One year on my skin is AMAZING.  I don't get cysts and spots any more. I have gained so much confidence and spend so little time thinking about my skin. So if like me you feel you have given up hope, I suggest you give this a go. A note of caution is that in the first 3-4months my skin purged terribly. It was awful and I nearly gave up. Also felt incredibly thirsty and couldn't stop going to the loo (they are a diuretic and make you pee). This has however all settled down. Body seems to have adjusted. No other side effects. Weight has remained normal and I feel great. So my advice is... stick with it and you will see the benefit. Good luck if you are suffering. Don't give up.”",10,"October 16, 2019",29
Spironolactone,  Acne," Started taking 100 mg spironolactone in June 2019  and saw visible results in my acne in 5 days of taking it. I suffered from the extremely tiny bumps all over my face not really pimples but under the skin bumps that had to be pushed out or they would remain regardless. My face routine: Any wash or water and extreme moisture Cerave , Aloe Vera, and Vaseline!  This is the only tough moisture barrier for the dry TX winter. Main side effect for me was exhaustion; sleep for 4 extra hours and sleep all throughout the night. I began to take it at night.  Now on 150 mg in response to being taken off of antibiotics.  Miracle drug, I am the only one in my family that suffers from acne my entire family including extended is known for there porcelain brown skin.
 Spironolactone has brought my period to be more regular.  In addition to that I have noticed some boob growth & they are sore at all times not an unbearable amount but noticeable. Though I don't plan to be on it forever I would do it all over again.”",9,"October 15, 2019",10
Spironolactone,  Acne," Please reconsider before starting this. Helped my acne, side effects are not worth it. I had no idea how lucky I was before taking this, just to feel no pain. Now I am 10 months off of this drug and I am still in pain every day. Was on it 6 months 25 mg 2x a day. In Jan, started feeling side effects: brain fog, fatigue, dizziness, loss of libido. Then chest pains/intense anxiety. Asked my dr if I could quit cold turkey? She said sure. Then...the next two weeks were so bad. Severe anxiety, panic attacks, tremors, short of breath, stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, depression, irregular heart beat, arm numbness, chest pain, all day every day. Ears ringing, sleep problems. Lost 25 lbs. Horrible. No drs had any advice, answers, or wanted to help. Ever since then the symptoms remain, but SLOWLY get better over time. Today I am better but still have chest pain, ear ringing, and digestive issues every day. Please do research, know the effects it could have. I would take acne any day over this.”",1,"October 13, 2019",15
Spironolactone,  Acne," I'm in my late 20s, with an onset of cystic acne. I had stopped BC combo pill (that I was taking for acne) due to lack of insurance coverage and decided (once insured again) to take a different route. 

I have been taking Spironolactone for about 1 year (50 mg x2 daily). It has cleared up my acne fully... but at a cost of a barrage of side effects (excessive fatigue, constant peeing, irregular periods, anxiety, night terrors, mood swings, borderline low blood pressure). It's been exhausting combating the side effects and led me to stop the medication and go back to BC combo pill.

I do recommend the drug since it works but only in low doses (25mg). Once I started doing 100mg daily, the side effects just overwhelmed me.”",5,"October 10, 2019",10
Spironolactone,  Acne," This was the last thing my dermatologist wanted to try before we finally tried Accutane. I was on it for 4 months total and had gone up to 150mg. Sometimes I thought it was working but then I’d still have a bad breakout every few weeks. I had to stop because of the side effects in addition to not seeing effectiveness. Even while on the birth control pill I had my period more often than not. I also developed ovarian cysts, which are not listed as a potential side effect but my obgyn seemed to agree that they could have been triggered by the spiro. When I stopped taking my period stopped and went back to normal after 2 days and the pain from the cysts went away after a few months.”",,"October 10, 2019",12
Spironolactone,  Acne," This medication spironolactone literally saved my confidence. I’m a 25 female and I didn’t have serious issues with my acne until I literally turned 25. And it was bad just along my jaw, a bit on my checks and sides of my neck just below the jawlines. It was painful and it itched! I’m so incredibly thankful that I knew about spiro before I had my first big break out so I knew exactly what to request from my doctor so to combat the cystic acne. I’ve been taking this medication for about 8 months now and am now starting to see lasting improvement. Everything everyone says about waiting at least 3 or 4 months before you give up is right!! This medication doesn’t work overnight like we all might hope. But the results are worth the wait. If there was an option to post pictures I’d share in a heartbeat! You all are beautiful and please give the medicine a chance to work! (Only negative side effects I’ve ever had was standing up too fast and getting a lil dizzy)”",,"October 3, 2019",25
Spironolactone,  Acne," After taking the medicine spironolacton for about a week, for acne I started experiencing severe dizziness. I felt like I was going to fall over.

Spironolactone,  Acne, I am 35 year old and with the worst skin of my life after spironolactone. I never had terrible skin but always have fought off breakouts and seemed to always have 1 blemish. I started the beauty counter acne line last November and it made my skin terrible. I went to the dermatologist and he put me on 50mg of spironalactone and I immediately started to break out everywhere and in places I never break out. I went back 2 months later and was upped to 100mg. My skin continued to be terrible and much worse than before starting the medication.

Spironolactone,  Acne," I was on accutane 6 years ago & had great results for 2 years then acne came back despite being vegan, GF , refined sugar free, & plant based. have been on the pill for 6 years. I have tried easily $1000 worth of topicals over the years and none of them helped. I did NOT want to go on antibiotics (I get my acne from my mom who also was not cured by accutane & topicals. She had liver failure due to acne antibiotics). Spiro was the LAST option I could try. I lasted ONE WEEK on 100mg before my dr had me stop taking it due to such severe stomach problems. The CONSTANT built up gas, bloating, and constipation were 8/10 pain scale. I’m normally someone with visible ab muscles, but my stomach looked 8 months pregnant for an entire week. Laxatives, magnesium, peppermint/ginger/detox teas, warm lemon water, nothing even LESSENED the pain. I've never experienced such insane GI problems. The nurse said it was NOT my body getting used to it, but just how my body reacted.”",1,"September 27, 2019",5
Spironolactone,  Acne," My advice would be to try out spirolactone and see if it helps your acne! You can stop taking it if the side effects are unpleasant. I was on 50 mg for 2 years and I had no skincare routine while on it which was a mistake. Please make sure to combine this with a topical such as benzoyl peroxide or Tretinoin to get the full benefits. It gave me a 85% reduction in acne, my hair was a lot longer and thicker, body hair grew more slowly. But the side effects were too much for me (heart palpitations, panic attacks, peeing all the time). I couldn't see myself taking the drug forever which you will need to or else your acne will come back. Which is why I'm opting for accutane now.”",8,"September 26, 2019",8
Spironolactone,  Acne," Been taking spironolactone  for acne since the beginning of summer (June) 50mg, upped my dose to 100mg but gave me the worst panic attacks so had to go back down . Can’t say it’s really done much at all in the way of progress. My skins still awful and I’m now knowing I’ll have to go onto roaccutane with severe mental health issues. Works for some people but I’d say if you have any kind of mood disorder be very careful as I ended up in hospital”",2,"September 12, 2019",6
Spironolactone,  Acne," This drug spirolactone basically cured my hormonal acne. Took a few months for it to take effect. Once it did, my acne went away. The best part though, is that after a couple years of taking the drug, my dermatologist suggested I try a lower dose, I did so and it continued to work, so I decided to lower again and again until I tried without and my acne NEVER came back!!!  I personally never had a single side effect from the medication but it exceeded all expectations for me.  I even recommended it to my friend who has cystic acne and it has helped her tremendously.”",10,"September 10, 2019",19
Spironolactone,  Acne," This pill spironolactone was a life changer. I've had acne my whole life, Not your normal zits either. 1 month on these pills and my face was 80% cleared. However, it is a water pill. Be prepared to pee twice as much.”",8,"September 7, 2019",5
Spironolactone,  Acne," I am so so so so grateful wow! I’ve had acne since I was around like 12 until I was 18 when I started spironolactone. I was extremely sad about my acne and it had really affected my moods and definitely my sleep (constantly thinking and worrying about it) for years on end. I was very close to starting accutane (which I’m happy I didn’t - it’s a very intense drug) when my dermatologist recommended spirolactone. I’m extremely happy I chose to start taking it because my acne has gone from horrible to really amazing skin, I no longer feel like I can’t go outside without a full face of makeup! I know the feeling of being unsure about wether or not to start a drug but I would really really recommend spironolactone. I hope it helps you as it has me! It will get better! :)”",10,"September 7, 2019",14
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," I suffer of hirsutism for while now, more in my face area. I had take Spironolactone 50mg about 2 years ago and didn't see any change. I was constantly having headaches and I stop taking them for a while.  A few month ago my Dermatology prescribed Spironolactone 100mg.  This time I'm using a different pharmacy and the pills have a minty taste and smell compared to  the one from my previous pharmacy 2 years ago.  I decided to stop taking them again this time because I'm staring to get headaches again and my hair is thinner than before, causing my hair to break easily. So now that I stop taking Spironolactone I'm losing my hair like CRAZY. I don't now why this is happening and if it will stop eventually. Just beware of this side effects.”",2,"August 28, 2019",3
Spironolactone,  Acne," I have had hormonal acne since July 2018 after I turned 27.
Before that I had perfect skin.
I would get nodule, cysts and whiteheads on jawline chin and forehead. After trying everything on the market including antibiotics I decided to try spiro before my last resort accutane.
I'm on 100 mg a day for almost two months and a half now and I'm soooo happy with my skin. I still get a cyst here and there but I no longer get the daily ones I used to. This is a great improvement from 2 months ago and I can only imagine how much better I'll get in the 3-5 month mark. 
Aside from having to pee and nausea that's its causing me I don't care because I got my confidence back. It also helped with the oiliness of my skin and my hair shedding. I looooove this medication. Thank you spironolactone!!!!”",8,"August 28, 2019",11
Spironolactone,  Acne," I'll say that spironolactone helped my acne. Very much so.. I still would get pimples but not like I do when I don't take it.. I will say this.. I am 35 and have taken this medicine off and on for over 10 years. I truly believe it causes serious side affects. Dizzy, headaches, mood swings, bad anxiety, horrible cramps, stomach pain, acid reflux I could keep going. I even have this heart thing that I get sometimes. Really fast flutters. I've gotten sick really bad a few times since I've been on it and I never put 2 and 2 together until now. When I'm off of it all those problems go away. I will never take this again and I pray none of this is permanent. I have 6 children and want to be ok for them.”",4,"August 27, 2019",8
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," Be very careful of spirolactone if you have any history of depression, anxiety, or just general stress. Before I started taking spirolacton for PCOS-related hirsutism I had a tendency towards stress and mild anxiety but never a disorder - soon after I started on it my anxiety increased to a level I had never experienced before, and I had my first panic attack while just walking down the street and began having panic attacks almost daily. I had a feeling that this new anxiety was linked to starting this medication and a few months ago I found a study online in a medical journal that found that a single dose of spiro increases the release of cortisol (the stress hormone that floods your brain to cause panic attacks) by 100% within an hour of taking it. I immediately stopped taking the medication and since then I feel much better but still I am left with lasting daily anxiety. I wish I had been warned about spiro's effects on cortisol levels because I would have never started taking it.”",2,"August 18, 2019",16
Spironolactone,  Acne," I have had acne since my teens, pregnancy is what really wrecked my skin at 24 and 28 it was horrible. At almost 34 I finally decided to try my last attempt with a dermatologist last December. She suggested I try spiorlactone and Retina A together. after my The first day I did feel a little weird, I can't even explain it. I am sensitive to medicines though. I was super thirsty the first two days. By day 3 I felt completely fine. By the first week I had already noticed I had no new pimples. Prior I was getting them every few days. As soon as one would disappear I'd have another two. By the afternoon at work I'd discover an embarrassing white head and wonder how many people had seen it. I have now been on this medicine for almost 8 months, no side effects after day 3.  I can count on one hand how many breakouts I have had. My face is way less oily, I am at 75mg.”",10,"August 8, 2019",10
Spironolactone,  Acne," TLDR: Acne got worse before it got better. 100mg per day gave me best results but not worth the side effects of GI upset and diuresis. Lowered dose to 75mg at 6th month.

Baseline: Hormonal cyclic breakouts, 2-3 cystic and smaller pustules. Timeline: Months 1-3 acne got worse (8-10 lesions but not cystic) and I was taking 100mg/day (50mg am, 50mg pm). Month 4 it started to get better (5 lesions) Month 5 best results (1-2 lesions) but I started getting horrible GI upset like I would burp up food and continuously burp air for hours. Started cutting my pills to take 75mg/day (25mg am and 50mg pm). Month 7 decent results (3-4 lesions), but definitely better than where I started and I don't have all the peeing and burping.”",9,"August 7, 2019",10
Spironolactone,  Acne," I usually don't leave reviews on things, but hopefully this can help somebody else. I took spironolactone for 1.5 years, 50 mg/day! PLEASE do not take this drug for acne!!! Spironolactone showed about 60% improvement in my acne. However, my acne never went away. This is **not** a permanent solution and your acne will return once you stop taking it. I also experienced side effects like having to pee every 30 minutes, which caused me a lot of academic issues since I had to get up and leave my lectures. What spironolactone DID help with was my hair! Oh my gosh, I got so many compliments on my hair while on this drug! My hair was silky, shiny, and long and gorgeous! My skin also had a ""glow"" to it despite continuing to breakout. But for what it was worth, I wish I had just taken Accutane.”",7,"July 31, 2019",8
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," So its been one week and I suffer with PCOS. Specifically the symptom I hate the most is the excess facial hair growth. I can say when I was in my doctor’s office one week ago I had a full lady beard. And usually if I pluck it, it will grow full one week later. So its been one week on Spironolactone  later and I had nothing but little stubbles here and there. I can’t believe no one told me about this medicine before for facial hair. I’m actually impressed.”",9,"July 30, 2019",36
Spironolactone,  Acne," I've been on Spiro for 4+ months for hormonal acne.  I started at 25mg, then bumped to 50mg (25mg AM/25 PM) two weeks later. After 6 weeks increased to 75mg for 2 wks, 100mg after (split 50mg AM/50mg PM). Initially I responded well to the med but after increasing to 75mg/100mg my breakouts are worse than before.  I used to get my worst breakouts prior to menstruation; now they come between menstruation and ovulation.  My face is just starting to clear by the time my next period comes & then the cycle starts again.  Will discuss with my Derm next appointment in a week. I'm slightly disappointed because I have other conditions in which this med is helpful.  SIDE EFFECTS EXPERIENCED:  Headache and intense external vaginal itchiness that would start about 2 hrs after I took the medication and last for about 2-4 hrs after. The headache and itching side effects decreased each day over about 3-4 weeks and did not return when the dosages were increased.”",,"July 30, 2019",4
Spironolactone,  Alopecia," After many yrs of intermittant worrying bouts with hairloss , I noticed it getting worse on wards from 45 yrs to that point where I was lossing 300- 500 hairs at every hair wash!! Very scary and disheartening.

Blood work did not explain what was happening with any particular deficiencies, Dr suggested Spiro and I've been on it now for approx 4 mths and so happy with progress so far. Didn't notice much in way of side effects, perhaps slighty unsettled stomach for couple months. I will keep a watch on my kidney function as I know it can be impacted, try to drink extra water.
Can now wash hair with only approx 50 strand loss and very little loss in between washing. Not much regrowth as yet, very much hoping it will restart very soon! Hope this helps :)”",,"July 30, 2019",41
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," I have PCOS with all the classic symptoms. I see spiro as the a awful drug, the side effects are too much. When I was taking it along with other b/c pills, it helped lower my testosterone level and hair growth but the excessive peeing (will the time), excessive fatigue and mood swings it gave me was too much. I had to stop it. And all the symptoms came right back, even the acne it cured. I feel sad because it works but I'm so scared of going back to it even though I have a reduced dosage now, I still haven't talked myself into taking the pills again. Maybe it effects me so bad because I'm African. May  it doesn't suit Africans. I wish it would just work for me without all the side effects.”",1,"July 27, 2019",5
Spironolactone,  Alopecia," So I wasn't actually diagnosed with alopecia but there were miniature size hairs on scalp. My crown area was definitely balding and I’d have to part my hair a certain way so that it’d be less visible! Anyways, I got it checked out last March 2018 and took a few hormones test and turns out my DHEA Sulfate was on the higher side. So my doc prescribed me 50mg daily of spironolactone. After a few weeks I asked if I could do 100mg and I did. So I have been taking 100mg for a year now and see the incredible difference! My crown area isn't so bald- its been filling up with more hair! Couple days ago, I asked my doc to upgrade dosage to max 200mg! I’ve heard 200mg/daily is the magical number to see more results! So far, I have not had any side effects. Just make sure you take it with food! Goodluck!”",10,"July 26, 2019",37
Spironolactone,  Acne," I’ve had acne my whole life, it's always been pretty bad. Normally my skin has about 10 pimples on it & a bunch of red marks so I have to wear makeup to go anywhere & even then, you can see the texture. It makes me super insecure. I’ve been on antibiotics off and on since I was 17 (I’m 22 now) and my doctor said I had PCOS & prescribed spirolactone 100mg once a day. It’s July now & I'm still noticing breakouts. Most are cystic. The acne on my chin area has subsided but it seems like it moved to my cheeks? She upped the dose to 150mg about a week ago, maybe this is an reaction from raising the dose 50mg. I’ve also been drinking & eating really unhealthy lately,  and I’ve noticed my skin always looks worse when I do that, but it’s about to be the four month mark and I was hoping for even a slight difference in my skin. I’m reading that it takes some people 8 months to work. Praying that happens to me because I can’t go on Accutane & this is my last stop.”",4,"July 19, 2019",3
Spironolactone,  Acne," Have been on spirolactone for about 4 months now. My acne has become much worse since starting it, my face is extremely dry but most of all- I have absolutely NO sex drive anymore. Coming from a woman who usually has a very high libido, this is very upsetting and really affected my relationship with my partner and my self esteem. Have since chucked it out and my skin and libido have already improved.  Awful pill”",1,"July 18, 2019",5
Spironolactone,  Acne," Girls, please be careful. Spiro was my miracle drug for the first year. But now after 2 yrs its not working, my body has gotten used to it. Its aged me so much my face has sunken in, I feel so ugly. Its made me anorexic from dehydration (I drink 3 litres a day) you can see all my veins. It also caused extremely purple veins all over my legs. I'm depressed and all my muscles ache. Plus acne comes straight back when you stop.  It might be worth it for a few months but its not worth it in the long run :( fyi I'm a 27yr old”",3,"July 16, 2019",16
Spironolactone,  Acne," I have taken Spiro for one year. I had severe acne after going off BC, after over a decade. My PA prescribed 100 mg, and that helped but not enough. My PA would not increase dose until 6 months. The increase to 150 mg was a huge help. Over the last five years I have spent a lot of time on the Whole30/Paleo diet, but committed to altering my diet permanently to support skin, immunity, and discontinuation of Spiro first week of May 2019. The results have been astonishing. I wish I were able to attach a photo comparing my first week on Spiro with inconsistent diet modifications to now, as well as a side-by-side from the time I committed to that change to now, after two months of 95% dairy-free, grain and gluten-free. I have followed the Paleo diet, including no legumes (chickpeas, hummus, peanuts), however I do have refined sugar and make occasional other exceptions.”",8,"July 15, 2019",7
Spironolactone,  Acne," I wanted to wait until I saw results before I posted, good or bad. I’ve read almost every review on here before I was prescribed the medication and I was inspired! I have never had terribly bad acne as a teenager and adult. But I did have acne that was very persistent and that never really went away. 2 months before my 25th birthday I had my first painful cystic breakout. I have PCOS so I had been aware of this medication before I broke out. So the very first break out I had, which was bad and painful, I talked to my doctor about starting spiro. It’s taken me a whole month to see big angry lesions disappear. And while they still form, they heal in 2 days max and don’t come to a head. My skin is still red and purple and the hyperpigmentation is real but I’m confident with more time there will be more improvement! Waiting sucks but I fully trust that with time and persistence it’s only going to get better!”",7,"July 12, 2019",7
Spironolactone,  Acne," This drug has changed my life! I had perfect skin until I hit 30 year old. I started to get acne around me lower cheeks, which started like a rash. Small bumps, very red. Over time, the white heads and cystic acne started. My derm started me at 100 mg a day.  Within 3 weeks I had clear skin! Looking at the reviews, I was scared of a purge stage. Never experienced more acne while on this medication. The acne started to clear up immediately. I use spirolactone for hormonal acne in conjunction with Finacea and birth control. This combo has done wonders for my skin. I can go with no makeup and feel confident. The finacea has helped with the red spots left over from the large cystic acne I had. I had no bad side effects from this drug.”",10,"July 9, 2019",13
Spironolactone,  Alopecia," Girls I know everyone is different but BEWARE!!!

I started this for acne and hair loss and been on it for 2 years.. went from 25mg,50,75 to 100mg. 

At first all was good I was loving my skin but no notice in my hair I actually noticed it was getting drier.. 2 years on my hair has never been so dry, breaking and falling more u can see my scalp. Plus acne is coming back. 

Its caused extreme weight loss, purple veins all over the back of my legs, and muscle and bone pain so bad it hurts to walk I had to quit my job..

Mind u I was a healthy 27 yr old female. 

Be careful!!! 

Oh and ur hair falls sooooo bad when u stop it.”",3,"July 7, 2019",41
Spironolactone,  Acne, My derm put me on 25mg spirolactone 2x/day along with 0.25 trentinoin for acne. I’m experiencing more breakouts but I hear that’s common when you first start so I’m trying to keep hope alive. I also have 3 Theraclear treatments every week so I’m hoping that will calm the breakouts from just starting spiro. I think I’ll split the dose 25mg in morning and 25mg at night to see if that helps!”,5,"June 27, 2019",1
Spironolactone,  Acne," Started spirolactone about 2 weeks ago for acne, first week 1 a day 100g, now 2 a day. Definitely feeling dull and very tired. Skin is getting worse: red bumps with no whitehead and very dry and red patches on my neck and right side of my forehead on my temple so far. I do suffer from eczema, just haven’t had any on my neck in years. My Dr. said it would be 3 months before I would see any results, really hoping this helps my skin.

Spironolactone,  Acne," I was prescribed 25mg  spirolactone once a day for acne. I've taken Accutane 2 rounds over 10 years ago but I still have got horrible cysts on my face. My dermatologist said it was hormonal and that spirolactone would help me. After 2 weeks my face was so clear and acne free, my face/hair was no longer oily. But soon the happiness went away. By the beginning of the 2nd month my hair hair got so brittle/thin and losing over 300 hairs a day. I told my dermatologist who said its impossible because this med also helps grow hair. He took a full panel of blood work and the results said my testosterone levels were below normal. I was 4 and 8 was the minimum normal. Yes ladies we have testosterone in our bodies. He told me to stop the medication. My hair and face went back to being oily with acne but my hair is still gone. I lost over 75% of my hair and I don't know if it will grow back. I wear baseball caps to cover my almost bald head. It is so depressing because I had a full head of thick waist length hair.”",1,"June 14, 2019",13
Spironolactone,  Acne," 6 months ago, I suddenly had acne all over my face, back and neck. Nothing I tried work including cutting sweets out of my diet. I finally went to my dermatologist. She suggested Spironolactone(100mg in the morning and 50mg at night). I also use aczone and tretinoin. The first month was awful. My skin dried out so badly, it would bruise. I ended up with as much hyperpigmentation and I had acne. After taking it for 2.5 months, I started to notice a difference. My skin was recovering quicker after I popped a zit and wasn't breaking out in red as much. It has been almost 3 months and I am finally starting to see significant results. I still have about 3-5 zits but they are much smaller and I feel confident enough to go outside without make up caked on my face (something I haven't been able to do for over 6 months). If you are in the first few months of the medication, don't give up hope!”",10,"June 11, 2019",12
Spironolactone,  Acne," I started spironolactone two years ago for hormonal acne along my jawline and neck. I also had excessively oily skin and some random dark hairs growing on my chest and around my breasts. I started on 25mg, then 50mg, then up to 100mg (sometimes I go back down to 50mg for maintenance for a few months and increase back up to 100mg if symptoms start to reappear. My doctor approved this). It took a long time to start working, at least three months before I saw any change, with full results at around six months. I've had very little side effects that I can tell. I still have slightly oily skin, large pores, some very mild acne once a month and I still get a few dark hairs on my breasts sometimes. I'm ok with this as I know oily skin ages slower. However, I rarely get any hormonal acne on my jawline and I don't get any dark hair on my chest anymore (maybe one hair appears every six months that I just pluck) so I'm really happy with this medication. 
 I'm only on 50mg at the moment.”",9,"May 23, 2019",18
Spironolactone,  Acne," I have been on Spirolactone for 8 weeks. Overall, my skin is much clearer. I have not had any cystic nodules since I started.

I take 50 mg in the morning and 50mg at night.”",,"May 22, 2019",10
Spironolactone,  High Blood Pressure," I'm a 46 yo male and am taking spirolactone because of the nasty high blood pressure side effects of other drugs. Been taking this for 3 months, whilst it has lowered by BP it's not entirely effective, I'm still around 138/90. Side-effects have been bloatedness and wind, toilet 4x per day and occasional diarrhoea, weight gain, loss of libido.”",,"May 19, 2019",15
Spironolactone,  Acne," Spironolactone has been a blessing! I have the Mirena IUD and was prescribed by my GP for some small spiky hairs and acne that we believed to be triggered by Mirena. However I love the Mirena apart from those little problems so we looked to Spirolactone. 

I've only been taking 50mg a day, and have noticed good results. My skin is so much clearer, I've had way less Mr. Spikes and MY BOOBS ARE BIGGER. This is amazing for me considering I am a very petite girl. Side-effects have been very small, I had some shakiness the first week and do need the bathroom more but nothing major. I expect to stay on it a long time.”",9,"May 15, 2019",5

I am a 29 year old female that has struggled acne most of my life. I am now 7 months in and only have scars and some pigmentation. if you are woman that has a lot of acne here near your jawline this is definitely what you want to try! I'm so grateful for this pill!

Spironolactone,  Acne, I got a prescription for spirolactone 50mg a day to treat my hormonal acne (been on accutane 3 times before). It really did get worse before it got better for the first two months- jaw and chin breakouts and extreme dry patches. However in month 3 I could see a big improvement. I started using Eucerin's adjunctive soothing cream during the day and continued with differin at night and holding thumbs that it get even better from now on.”,8,"May 3, 2019",4
Spironolactone,  Acne," The year I turned 21, my acne became unbearable. I did not even want to leave the house. I would cry about it almost every day. My dermatologist prescribed me 100mg of spironolactone and tretinoin cream. The first two months were terrible. I knew I was purging, but it felt like my acne was never going to get better. It drastically affected my mood and I turned down plans left and right because I did not want to see anyone. Every morning before any of my college roommates woke up, I would run to the bathroom to cover my acne so no one would see. I even broke down in tears in front of my friends because I was so frustrated. 

Fast forward to 4 months later and my skin is CLEAR.  I am so happy it is almost difficult to explain. My advice is to be patient. Just know that it really does take 4 months but after that, you will feel like a new person.”",,"April 29, 2019",26
Spironolactone,  Acne, Going on the second week of this taking spirolactone for my acne at a dose of only 12.5mg because I have blood pressure at the low end of normal. Since yesterday I’ve been feeling slightly  nauseous and brain fog all day and I didn’t take my dose for today. I don’t know if it’s from the medication or what but I’m too nervous to take it anymore. It hasn’t done anything for my acne yet but I don’t know if taking it longer it would have helped or not but I’m too scared to risk it. I really wanted this to work because I’m not one to want to be put on birth control. Maybe I’ll try it again once I feel better to see if it actually was the medication making me feel sick like this or something else.”,3,"April 24, 2019",4
Spironolactone,  Acne," Spironolactone has worked miracles for me! I had to go off of birth control pills last July for health reasons. By August my face would have at least 30 breakouts at all times. I have struggled with acne since I was 12, I am now 25. I took accutane when I was 18 but the acne just came back. Birth control helped but did not clear my skin. I started on 25mg of spironolactone in August and then went up to 50 mg in October. I am 5’7” 115lbs so my dermatologist wanted to start me off slow to adjust.  The dermatologist then increased my dose to 150 mg in December and then to 200mg in February. I did not see any results until the first of March so it took 8 month for it to help me. Now in April, I am completely clear. I haven’t had a breakout for 6 weeks! Spironolactone is amazing. I’m so glad I stuck it out and did not quit taking when it was not helping for so long. I plan to cut down to 100-150mg to maintain.”",10,"April 21, 2019",9
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," I started taking spirolactone about 10 months ago for PCOS, hirsutism, and to lower my free testosterone, it was at 11. 
Starting dosage 25mg twice daily for 4 months = free testosterone lower to 8.5. Doctor increase dosage to
50mg twice daily for 6 months = Free testosterone is at 7.9, slightly less facial hair, facial skin is clear and smooth (previously had orange peel skin), slightly less oily skin too, no weight gain. Doctor has increase dosage to 100mg twice a day to continue to lower free testosterone and hopefully be less hairy. Will post update in 6 months.”",7,"April 19, 2019",47
Spironolactone,  Acne," I am currently 21 and until I was about 19, I was one of those people who had annoyingly clear skin. I started to breakout on my cheeks, chin, and jawline. I was in and out of the derm (who kind of sucked at her job in hindsight) for the past two years taking topical antibiotics, retinoids, and trying and hating minocycline. I really had a gut feeling it was all hormonal so I was prescribed spiro (finally). I have been on this pill almost six months now and I am probably 80/90% clear now. Around 2/3 months I broke out really bad and was honestly scared to keep taking it. I stuck it out and about a month later started to see results. I haven't got a real cysts since the 3 month mark. I am way less oily and feel like I'm way more in control of my skin. It's definitely not perfect yet but there's progress. So don't be discouraged!! It can take our bodies a long time to adjust and process hormones. Everyone is different! Be patient and in the meantime try to stay active and eat healthy.”",8,"April 15, 2019",11
Spironolactone,Edema," I took chlorthalidone and amlodipine for several years for high blood pressure (HBP). The latter caused unsightly leg edema.

Spironolactone,  Acne, When I first started taking spironolactone my skin cleared instantly and it is perfect clear 5 months later. However- 3 months after taking it I had to get my gallbladder removed from severe attacks and stomach pains. I looked it up and there were lawsuits on this as a side effect. No acne pill is worth the pain I have went through (and am still going through)”,3,"April 10, 2019",11
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovaries at age 19 in 2003.  My doctor started me on spironolactone for the hirsutism on my sideburns, chin, lip, and belly area.  I took the medication for several months and never noticed a decrease in the hair growth or the hair growth becoming lighter.  Apparently, it doesn't work for all patients with PCOS.”",1,"April 4, 2019",21
Spironolactone,  Acne," I started this medication January 17th. My dermatologist said it would clear up a few acne bumps that I get on my jaw line and chin.  I have no other problem places on my face.  I started out on 50mg, once a day. The first couple days I had horrible stomach issues and a pounding headache. After the 2 days the stomach issue went away, but my headache never went away.  About a week after starting this medication the purge happened. I immediately started reading reviews and decided it was normal and it would be fast, furious and temporary.  By week 3 I had acne everywhere! My cheeks, nose, forehead etc. The doctor decided to up my dose to 100mg and also gave me 100mg of Doxycycline. She said it would kill the acne with 3 days. Another week went by and I was getting dizzy, dry, my left leg was going numb, headache was blinding and more acne now moving onto my neck. I let this go on until mid March. I flushed the medicine. I feel so much better now.”",1,"April 3, 2019",10
Spironolactone,  Acne," I’m so happy I went on spironolactone! I was so ready to try anything (even accutane) when spironolactone was prescribed to me. I didn’t hesitate to go on it but I did have doubts in my mind about wether it would work or not bc I have gone thru many pills. Before taking this pill I didn’t think I had hormonal acne because I had acne all over my face and in my mind hormonal acne was meant to be on the jawline and chin. The dr explained to me that she would like to put me on this pill because I had been telling her that my skin would break out like crazy and the calm down for like a week before breaking out again - a sign of hormonal acne. My derm. put me on 50 mg to take at night but that didn’t change anything so she raised my dosage to 100 mg. About 3 months after taking my first pill I saw major change in my face. Of course it gets better slowly which is why you’ll one day look back at pics and be like woah my skin really is a lot better!
Didn’t have enough typing space to write more :(”",9,"April 3, 2019",10
Spironolactone,  Alopecia, I have been using a low dose of 25mg for 3 months now. Originally I noticed less shedding but currently my hair is thinner than before. Having moderate shedding now with diffuse hair loss. Has not improved the condition of my hair at all.”,3,"April 1, 2019",27
Spironolactone,  Alopecia, Have been on spironolactone for 25 mg daily for 2 months and have noticed a significant reduction in hair loss!!! It works!”,10,"April 1, 2019",33
Spironolactone,  Acne," I was prescribed spironolactone for acne. It's off label and rarely prescribed in the UK. My acne is very severe, and I've tried every acne treatment apart from birth control pills as I have a stroke risk. My dermatologist prescribed me 100mg spironolactone to take once a day. My acne continued to worsen for the first few months. I did some online anecdotal research and began splitting the dose, taking it every 12 hours. It started to work! My dermatologist  supported the dose-splitting, and doubled my dose (100mg twice a day) and it's been really working since! I have the occasional spot or two and especially around my period. But it  feels like an absolute miracle for me! I probably pee and drink a bit more, I've been having two periods a month (although it's more like two half periods) and my skin is significantly drier (all over) even than it was on roaccutane. I still take each day as it comes, but I wish there would be more research into spironolactone so it could help more people like me.”",10,"March 31, 2019",4
Spironolactone,  Acne," Spironolactone worked great for my acne. It did take around 3 months for it to noticeably work, but it has done wonders! The only side effect I've noticed is that a have extremely vivid dreams/nightmares every night. I only saw one other person to mention this..so I don't know if it's extremely rare or if no one else has noticed.”",9,"March 23, 2019",12
Spironolactone,  Acne," I’ve been on spiro  for my acne for exactly 2 months. I’m taking 100mg. 50 in the morning and 50 at night. The only side effect I get is having to pee constantly but it’s not that serious. My acne has gotten worse, I now get acne in spots on my face where I never had it before. The acne come up in little balls and they never reach to a head they kind of just stay under the skin then rise up and slowly slowly SLOWLY get smaller. I hope that made any sense. The acne is also bright red and I hate my face so much. I’m gonna stay on the medication because I’m looking for the light at the end of the tunnel - it is suppose to get better”",3,"March 18, 2019",16
Spironolactone,Alopecia, I started taking spiractin 50mg 10 months ago for alopecia and saw instant results. In 2 weeks my hair stopped shedding and I grew back all the hair I had lost in past 2 years. However it just stopped working 4 months ago and now I’m shedding over 200 hairs a day. My dermatologist doubled the dose to 100mg 2 months ago but unfortunately it’s made zero impact :(”,5,"March 16, 2019",32
Spironolactone,Acne,"			 My hair, as expected started shedding after pregnancy, but then just wouldn't stop. 3 years after my last pregnancy my hair was still shedding like crazy & was looking very limp and sad. I had to wear clip in extensions daily to have any volume at all. My dermatologist said some women have chronic post partum hair loss (thats me) so she started me on 50mg spirolactone then went up to 100mg and in 3-4 months noticed a drastic difference - it works. The shedding stopped and hair felt fuller and healthier and I could see lots of new hair growth. She upped me to 150mg and I am at about 6 months now and improvements continue. I've had no issues other than peeing more and periods got a bit sporadic for a bit but seem to be going back to normal. I am so happy with this medication and it saved me from the dread & anxiety that was constantly there about my hair loss.”",10,"March 15, 2019",3
Spironolactone,  Acne, I have had very bad hormonal acne since I was in middle school. My doctor put me on birth control which helped somewhat but not enough to notice a difference. I finally went on spironolcatone a little over a year ago and it was the best decision of my life. I barely have breakouts anymore. I take two 25mg pills a day. It doesn’t have any horrible side effects the only change is I drink and pee more which is worth the clear skin.”,10,"March 13, 2019",7
Spironolactone,Acne,"			 I have been using spironolactone  for hidradenitis suppurativa since July 2018. I started at 50mg and didn't see a difference until October 2018 when I got put on 100mg. It's been incredible, I have about one flare (single bump) a month, maximum! I used to flare constantly with more than one bump at a time. This medication is a LIFESAVER!! The only side effect I have is frequent menstruation, for which I take a low-dose combination pill.

Now I can live without fear of my hidradenitis stopping me (not trying to sound like an ad, I actually really mean it)!!”",9,"March 12, 2019",5
Spironolactone,  Acne, Long story short I have suffered from acne on and off for the past 10 years. I am 25 (f) now and have been on 100mg/day spironolactone as well as oral antiobiotics 150mg/day and topical tretinoin and birthcontrol. As you can see my derm loaded me up but after being on the BC for 3 months and then starting the spiro/antibiotics almost 3 weeks ago my face has gotten 95% better. I have only two pimples instead of having a face full. The only issue now is to get rid of the stubborn hyper pigmentation I've been left with... but I'm using facial peels which seems to be helping with that. I hope this helps someone in the same boat as me feeling as discouraged as I did.”,10,"March 5, 2019",8
Spironolactone,  Acne," I was told 3 weeks ago I have  Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and PCOS. Went to a dermatologist to try and get help, so I can get my skin under control. Within the first week, under my arms did start to clear up, and I was feeling pretty good to START.  After a couple more days I fainted. My dermatologist failed to mention that this is a medication for not just acne and hormonal balancing, but more for people with blood pressure issues. It just happened to help clear up your skin too. I did some research and was trying to abide by what it recommended you eat and drink with it. The 3rd week I was on this, started to feel dizziness, lightheaded. Next thing I know my heart was raising, shaking, chest pains and having a panic attack. This dermatologist told me that I wouldn't notice any major symptoms, I just might be peeing more. My Dr started me on 100mgs but I've read other reviews from other women who experienced the same if not worse symptoms than me and were on lower doses.  I stopped taking the medication.”",4,"March 3, 2019",8
Spironolactone,  Acne," For over 10 years, I suffered from moderate to severe acne that only got worse with time. I'm 26 (F) now. As a teenager, it started with my face and gradually became an issue on my back and upper chest. I hoped that my skin would clear up after I entered my 20s as it does for so many other young people. Unfortunately, the opposite happened. I started to notice that my acne would get much worse during my monthly cycle, which became more apparent after I reached adulthood and meant it was hormonal. I visited a dermatologist and she gave me this med. Within a month or two of taking it, my acne started clearing up. The first improvement I noticed was on my face. Even during my period, it would remain clear. I still had the occasional breakout but it was nothing like it had been. After a few more weeks, my back and chest began to clear (2 or 3 month mark). It’s been over a year since I started taking Spiro and I am thrilled with the results. My skin is almost completely clear.”",9,"January 28, 2019",9
Spironolactone,  Alopecia," I have always had thick hair.  I noticed at around age 47, I was shedding more. And even more alarming, my hair stylist commented on the shedding when she washed my hair.   Mostly through the temples, but also a widening part.  I've been on Spironolactone for a little over a year at 100mg.   I feel like I have lots baby hairs through the temple, and my part looks more normal (sometimes I wonder if I see what I want to see...)  BUT because my hair was so thick before, I was less worried about regrowing, and more concerned about stopping or slowing down the shedding. I do think I am back to shedding normal amounts of hair. I take one 100 mg pill at night and sleep through any side effects I'd have, but usually have to get up once to use the loo.   I've read other comments about decreased libidio..  I do think I have a little of this but FEELING attractive has it's own upside.  I do regularly have my potassium levels checked.”",9,"January 8, 2019",21
Spironolactone,  Primary Hyperaldosteronism," A perfect drug for me, having the diagnosis, since the mid '90s. The dose is however is 300mg, to obtain normal potassium levels and reasonable blood pleasure.”",10,"January 6, 2019",7
Spironolactone,  Acne," I was prescribed Accutane when I had very mild acne, and 4 months after taking it I was acne free (like seriously never had a pimple at all). That was all fine and dandy until 8 months later August 2018 I was hit with a cystic pimple that would just not go away and from that day on it spread. I now have acne all over my face and it not only takes forever to go away but all of them seem to be scarring. I started Spironolactone (50mg/Day) and Retin A on November 17th and my acne has gotten MUCH worse. I am having cystic breakouts everywhere. It went from my cheeks now to my forehead and smile lines, and my skin Is super dry!! I know you’re supposed to wait at least 2-3 months to start seeing results but I’m beginning to think if it’s just making it worse to go back on a second dose of Accutane as I feel I have tried everything!!!”",1,"December 26, 2018",6
Spironolactone,  High Blood Pressure," Used half a tab of 25mg daily for two weeks with a two day interval between the weeks due to rash developing near belly button. Upon resumption no further rashes, but instead a tendinitis flareup with it starting to spread to the ankle. So I stopped taking it. Lab results with this small amount showed potassium slightly out of range, 5.5 on a scale of 2-5.3.  The half tab didn't do a lot to keep BP down when added to 30mg Lisinipril I take. So I stopped taking it. I now believe most BP medicines were designed thinking someone from 60 up is sedentary. When one is a senior athlete I believe they leach something out of tendons and muscles causing problems.”",,"December 20, 2018",18
Spironolactone,  Acne," I have been on spiro for about 9 months and it was done wonders for my acne. HOWEVER, over the past couple months I feel like all this medication is catching up to me. I have a constant dull headache, sometimes feel dizzy and lightheaded, I am sleepy 24/7, I just feel like I’m in a fog all the time. It’s an awful feeling. I take 100mg per day and am considering either lowering the dosage to 50mg or just completely stop taking it. I love what’s its done for my acne but at this point it’s affecting my life too much that it’s not worth it. I’m just worried my acne will come back if i stop it completely:(”",6,"December 16, 2018",12
Spironolactone,  Acne," I had tried nearly everything when my derm gave me two options: Accutane or Spironolactone. I was undecided at first but after reading a scientific journal about the higher rate of acne relapse of accutane users who have HORMONAL acne) I decided on the Spiro. I was so anxious taking that first pill. I started on Oct. 9th, 2018. 100 mg a day. I was expecting a wait of up to 6 months before progress. It is now Dec. 9th, 2018 and I am acne free. I no longer get painful cysts on the jawline before my period. The relief is amazing. And my hair is MUCH thicker now! Everyone comments and asks what I’ve been using on it! But it’s just the Spiro. It’s truly insane how unbalanced hormones can negatively affect your body. I know everyone will have a different experience but if you have hormonal acne, Spiro is definitely worth a shot.”",,"December 9, 2018",23
Spironolactone,  Acne," Today are my Day 15 taken this medicine . I just want to left the record here for further refer . Thanks for those who left the positive comment here who support me continue taken this medicine.

Since I started taking medicine, the drugs have brought me more frequent urination than before. my face now has  new small pimples on the whole face, even the rare forehead and chin, one or two behind.  I also have lethargy, emotional pessimism, etc. Wait.
My face has been plagued by acne for four years, and I have been troubled by the fact that it did not break out before. Most of my problems are on my cheeks, all of which are closed-head acne. I will continue to take it because this is my last hope. I hope to keep a progress report on how it goes.”",5,"November 27, 2018",6
Spironolactone,  Acne," I was on this medication for 10-12 years for severe acne and I must say that it clears your acne up pretty good.  I noticed that it burned my throat as I took it, but I was willing to take it to clear up my skin.  About 4-5 years ago, I started having flushing of the face.  Then almost 2 years ago, I started having severe heartburn, acid reflux, etc.  Now something's wrong with my digestive system and I've got to have further testing done.  I have obviously stopped taking this medication, but I didn't know it was the cause of my problems for a long time.  So I just have to say that if you start having heartburn or it makes your heartburn worse, stop taking this medication!  It isn't worth it.”",3,"November 25, 2018",12
Spironolactone,  Acne," Best pill for acne!! I experienced no purge. Was a bit tired for the first week and peed a little more but that's about it. Started working right away pretty much & I didn't even think I had hormonal acne! I was doing the natural route for a bit but saw no improvements and gave up. I was seeing a naturopath and it showed I was sensitive to sugar, wheat, and dairy so I was eating a strict diet, if this is you then it is probably hormonal! So happy I can eat whatever now and not have to worry. I have been on only for 2 months also.”",10,"November 15, 2018",14
Spironolactone,Acne," This medication was prescribed to treat my hormonal acne. The side effects that I experienced outweighed any positives. I did observe my acne to subside, but my skin became so dry and parched doing so. My face looked sunken in, and aged. I'm only 27, and I do not smoke and only occasionally consume alcoholic beverages. My libido was nearly nonexistent. I was very dry in my genitals, and could not self lubricate for sex. My hair was also incredibly dry, and brittle, and I noticed hair thinning at my scalp. My hair was coming out noticeably more as well. I was having difficulty sleeping. I gained nearly 10 pounds since starting... I eat fairly healthy and balanced. I was only on Spiro for roughly 4 months. I've been off of it for only a few days, but I swear I already feel and look so much better. Ill take some pimples and oily (but healthy) facial skin.”",3,"October 31, 2018",15
Spironolactone,  Alopecia," As a young woman I noticed my hair thinning.  I was losing up to a hundred strands of hair just in the shower. Then I had my three children and my hair stabilized for awhile.  At about 36 I started to lose hair again and my dermatologist prescribed spirolactone.  It was only about 50 milligrams daily, but it worked.  My hair was still fine, but soft and full.  I weaned myself to 25 milligrams and then off, all in about five years. Now I’m 55.  A year ago I noticed loss again, but worse.  My dermatologist put me on 100 mgs daily. At first I was dehydrated and had terrible night cramps.  I increased my water consumption and don’t drink as much in the evening.  Now I sleep through the night and I am cramp free.  I have noticed a dramatic change and have no concerns about my hair.  Right now I take a break every three days, but will soon start to reduce my daily intake.  For me this medication is amazing and I hope that everyone has the success I’ve had.”",10,"October 23, 2018",56
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism, I started to get hairs on my face and kneck when I turned 24 years old.  After that it just got worse to the point of having a full beard. Very embarrassing. I did lazer hair removal which didn't help since they didn't know what was causing the growth. I have been taking 100mg of spirolactane twice a day now for around a year. There are less hairs my leg armpit hairs etc. Grow at a normal rate now. I still have a fair amount of unwanted hair but it is fine and blonde now rather than course and black. I can grow my chin hairs out to wax them without people staring at me like I'm a mutant now so that's a plus. I will never stop taking these pills and may eventually see if my doc will up the dosage again.”,10,"October 3, 2018",32
Spironolactone,  Acne," I had a great experience with Spironolactone until my pharmacy changed the pill. I’m not sure what brand I was on before but I know it had a minty coating and worked really well! I saw complete skin clearing within 3-4 months. Then the pill was changed and the bottle says  Accord Healthcare” and the acne has come back, almost worse than before. Really frustrating that different brands of the same drug will cause such drastic changes.”",5,"October 2, 2018",22
Spironolactone,  Acne," First of all: yes it works! This medication was the best decision I ever made in my 10 years of battling acne. This journey began when I was only 9 years old. At my physical when  10 years old I was prescribed EpiDuo.  Didn’t work for months. I saw a local dermo on a monthly basis for 4 yrs tried Adapalene, Tretinoin, you name it, last treatment we tried was minocycline Big mistake, big allergic reaction, big hospital bill. After that dermo will not help me because of the situation. I went on to other products spending $2000+, lactic acid, peels, scar removals etc. Then noticed my period was not normal which  brought me to see an endo and gyno and am diagnosed with PCOS. I  started with birth control which wasn’t for me. Then prescribed aldactone. With no hopes, as they said may help with acne but mainly for PCOS. My skin cleared up after two weeks. This was what I needed after my 10 year battle. If I could tel anyone, please try this if topicals don’t work. Best medication ever. No side effects for me.”",10,"September 22, 2018",15
Spironolactone,  High Blood Pressure, This medication doesn't work very well on bringing my blood pressure and the mint coating gives me awful heartburn”,5,"September 19, 2018",14
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," I have been taking spirinolactone for going on two years in March (2019). I can say that my chin hairs, though still dark, are not nearly as many and they are definitely not as course as they were. I’m kinda small so my doctor will not up my dosage from 50mg a day because I get dizzy really easily and I actually thank her for having the foresight to know that. At 37 years old I have had this condition a really long time so it would be foolish for me to think that it should go away in a short amount of time. I would say to those still waiting, give it time. Also, I was seeing a substantial amount of results until I starting getting my face waxed, then noticed my hair growing back and quickly. Then I was told this week by a waxer at European wax center that some of these wax shops (including them) use a growth serum after waxing (so that their customers will come back), she was sure that my previous waxers probably were using the serum on me (for a whole year!). Time to start doing my own waxing!”",9,"September 16, 2018",22
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," I have been taking spironolactone for 3 years to treat severe hirsutism. (dosage has been adjusted a few times, currently 100mg). My only side effect was occasional low sodium, which is easily remedied with diet or salt tablets. 
I shave my face daily, and even with a smooth shave my hair is so dark and coarse it is visible under the skin. Not only has spironolactone not helped, my hirsutism has continued to get worse.
Also, my aldosterone (LCMS, serum) was 9.3 before starting spironolactone. It increased but stayed within normal range while taking 50mg/day. After taking 200mg/day for a few months, my aldosterone went up to 45.9.”",1,"August 24, 2018",19
Spironolactone,  Edema," Drug was initiated in combination with Furosemide while hospitalized for liver disease with ascites. Was told this was the gold standard treatment for this.  Result was fluid shifts, electrolyte imbalance, impaired kidneys and severe muscle cramping.  Nine months off this drug and the reduced kidney function and high potassium levels persist.  For some people the potassium sparing does not stop when the drug is discontinued.  There is no antidote for it.”",1,"August 12, 2018",11
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism, I'm on day 190ish of 100mg. I have been on it for more than a year but my doctor just reupped my dosage. I am on it for excessive facial hair (shave daily) blood pressure and acne. I have only had the lower blood pressure and less arm pit hair. I still have to shave daily or I have a 5 o'clock shadow. Going to doctor soon to hopefully find something better.”,4,"August 3, 2018",9
Spironolactone,  Acne," This is the best medicine I've ever taken for acne and I've tried so many. It really helped make my skin less oily, so I have significantly fewer breakouts (even period-related breakouts have stopped). It is taken orally so you don't have to get medicine on your pillow and towels, it's the best. I haven't experienced any side effects.”",10,"July 5, 2018",10
Spironolactone,  High Blood Pressure," For those of you who have you spironolactone for years and now received a different brand, and it's not working, you are in the same boat with all spironolactone users regardless of diagnosis. Apparently the manufacturers of Par and Actavis decided to stop making this drug, and no one can figure out as to why. The manufacturer Cadista had stepped in and producing a brownish round pill that seems to do nothing for people who really need spironolactone for their health. Call the FDA, call your Physician, call your Pharmacist, and request that the spironolactone be manufactured by Par or Actavis which is a oval, white pill be reproduced so we can get back to being healthy again!  Not to scare you, but Canada is also having some of the same shortages.”",,"June 27, 2018",27
Spironolactone,  Acne," I considered spironolactone a miracle for a couple years, then CVS started giving me a different brand generic. It does not work at all! I don't have the brand info from my previous pills. This new pill says ""Accord Healthcare] on the label. It also has a vile odor.”",6,"June 24, 2018",12
Spironolactone,  Alopecia," I had suffered from hair loss for 3 years. I now have been taking spirolactone 50mg per day for 2 weeks and my hair stopped shedding! I tried everything but nothing works like spironolatone. I feel free. I can wash my hair more than twice a month without feeling depressed at all the hair falling out. Also, zero side effects so far.”",9,"June 21, 2018",58
Spironolactone,  Acne," I've been on a low dose of 50 mg for 4 months now and Spiro works! You will purge badly at the beginning but you just have to get through it somehow because the results will be so worth it. If you're experiencing really bad side effects like headaches or stomach issues, try experimenting with different brands because unfortunately some brands will give you horrible side effects while others won't. I'm taking a generic with little/no side effects, the only thing I have is a dry, flakey scalp and ears.”",10,"June 16, 2018",10
Spironolactone,  Acne," I posted a comment about spirolactone here last Sept2017 at that time, there were almost no changes especially with my face being oily and facial acne looking exaggerated. 

Starting last February 2018, the dramatic change happened, exactly 8 months later. My face cleared up and the oiliness was gone. Now I get 1-2 very tiny pimples (very unnoticeable) before my period. I shifted from 100mg June-February to 50mg Feb-May2018. 

Good luck on your journey guys! 
I hope this helped.

Spironolactone,High Blood Pressure," I’ve had high blood pressure since my early forties. When I turned 50, my blood pressure became harder to control. I was on the max dosage of lisinopril, and I tried various others but the best my blood pressure would get is 140/88. I went to a cardiologist and he prescribed aldactone, along with 40mg of lisinopril. My bp has been perfect a 120/70 from then on. It’s been three years since I started it.”",10,"May 19, 2018",46
Spironolactone,  Acne," This medicine has changed my life!  I used to suffer from terrible cystic acne.  My skin was always inflamed and the healing process was extremely delayed... it was horrible!  I have read many reviews that mentioned an adjustment period (a month or two of worsened acne) prior to any desired effects, but - for me - this was not the case.  This medication proved beneficial within the first week and continued to improve as the dose was adjusted (though I am still only on a very small dose, twice a day).  One added (and unexpected) benefit was that I stopped getting cold sores.  Seriously.  Recurrence  of cold sores was getting entirely out of control (to the point where I was having to take preventative medicine nearly every other day) and - after starting this medicine - the recurrences completely stopped!  Best side effect ever!  Anyhow, my skin is now clear - with exception of the rare tiny pimple - and I am free of cold sores.  Have not had any problems and am so incredibly happy.”",10,"May 15, 2018",13
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," I could pluck hairs, go to bed, wake up in the morning and have new hairs. The hairs were very thick and coarse. This causes dark spots on my jawline. I was ashamed to look people in the face. I went to multiple doctors through the years. I have been using Spirolactone less than a week with noticeable improvement. I keep looking in the mirror and trying to find hair. My skin softer and smoother. I can't believe I suffered for 30 years and seeing results so fast.

Spironolactone,  Alopecia," My specialist has yet to diagnose me because I'm right on the line of TE and androgenic alopecia. Either way my hair started falling out rapidly and I was horrified. I was put on 25mg of spirolactone and then increased to 100mg. This has helped me DRAMATICALLY. I've been on spiro for 8 months and just began 100mg 2 months ago and I think its safe to say 90% of my hair is back! I felt the dizziness mentioned in reviews only for the first month or so when I was taking 25mg then I was fine. However, it has significantly lowered my sex drive but give a little take a little. I was becoming so upset and self conscious and now I feel like myself again. After chopping off 4 inches of dry brittle hair that ai started with I'm left with a thicker, healthier, bob. Very very happy.”",9,"March 30, 2018",53
Spironolactone,  Acne," female adult mid 50's with acne most of life, 2nd report after 1 year. No new acne problems, just the scarring left over. No side effects, still have to wear make up to cover blemishes but acne free. Take 50mg once a day and not sure how long I will be able to stay on this medication?  I did think I would have this beautiful make up free skin so I am disappointed about that.  But the main goal was to rid of acne and this has happened. Would do this medication again.”",8,"March 29, 2018",5
Spironolactone,  Acne," This drug is fantastic for hormonal acne. I had bad acne as a teen, and while most of it went away, I have had nasty cystic zits on my chin since then. I'm 40 now, had tried all kinds of OTC and prescription creams and washes that didn't do much.

So my dermatologist suggested spironolactone, and it changed EVERYTHING. I went from 1-4 zits all the time to maybe one, small, quick-healing pimple when I have my period. 

Be sure to give it a couple of months to allow the drug to work and allow the side effects to fade. I don't have side effects now that I've been taking it for 5 month, but during the first month or two I had some bleeding outside of my period. It took about that long for the positive effects to kick in, too. It was frustrating but I'm so glad I stuck with it.”",10,"March 27, 2018",11

Spironolactone,  High Blood Pressure," Took medication for 2 days, woke up with severe diarrhea, stomach pains & severe vomiting.  My body became VERY dehydrated and legs, ankles and feet began to have muscle spasms.  After finally keeping some sea salt down I was able to go back to work after 48 hours of cramping!  Continued taking this medication for another 3 weeks but my stomach was so messed up I still haven't gone back to eating meats.  Cramps have come back and today my primary, who didn't prescribe this medication said this medication was the culprit and took me off of it.  He stated the medication has all my electrolytes all out of balance. Other symptoms are extreme muscle weakness and uncontrollable drowsiness, sharp pains throughout my body, bad headaches, tightness in head, dizziness & unexplained confusion, very scary side effects.  It appears this medication may hold on to potassium but it definitely sucked the other electrolytes out of me.  I wouldn't recommend this medication to anyone.”",1,"March 22, 2018",32
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," I have PCOS and take this medicine for face/body acne and hirsutism. 
I have hair on my face,  chest,  and stomach. I have been on 50 mg/day of spiro for almost three years and it has helped a lot.  My acne is reduced and so is my face and body hair,  and I don't have any side effects.  It also makes me less prone to bloating.  I did recently go up to 100 mg/day because although there has been a big improvement, I do still have a bit of body and facial hair and I do still get a bit of acne.  I'm trying to see how much an increase in dose would help.  I definitely suggest this medicine,  I love it.  Just make sure your doctor checks your electrolyte levels periodically while you are on it.”",10,"March 12, 2018",24
Spironolactone,  Alopecia," My dermatologist suggested I start this medication as I was seeing a lot of hair shedding.

I'm taking 50mg a day. I've been taking it for 2 weeks and I cannot believe how much it's stopped the shedding. Where I lost a sizeable amount (80+) of hair a day, I'm only shedding ~30 hairs.

The only side affect I've been having is slight heartburn.

Looking forward to continuing to use this medicine!”",8,"March 8, 2018",32
Spironolactone,Hirsutism," I was diagnosed with  2 years ago with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)and was prescribed aldactone 50mg and metformin 500mg two times a day. Was never regular in taking the medicine. Skipped it for months in a row. Problem started 5-6 months back when my body hair, side burns, upper lip and chin hair started increasing. Last month I plucked out almost 80 really thick hair out of my chin and I had a stupid five o clock shadow on my upper lip after shaving. I was desperate and started taking the meds properly.  Trust me people it's not even a month and the thickness of unwanted hair became half and grows really slow.  All you have to do is have faith and never miss a tablet. It really  can do wonders in your life.”",9,"February 26, 2018",36

At first it seemed to work as it lowered my BP and helped with my swollen ankles and feet. I noticed that Spironolactone improved my Breathing some after taking for about a month. I now have a red welt or blister on my left shin near my ankle. Its been there for almost a year. My blood pressure is still good due to Losartin, but my ankles are now always swollen and my breathing is back to the way it was, so-so.

Spironolactone,  Acne," I’ve been using Spirinolactone for 4 months with no results. I was hoping to see any, but I didn’t. My skin was as bad, as before. Also  this Med goes through our liver and in a long run can cause digestive problems. It gave me cramps, I lost some weight , skin stopped being oily, but acne didn’t go away.

Spironolactone,  Alopecia," I was put on this for HS. I was also diagnosed with Alopecia 10 years ago and have always had issues with thinning hair. Hair is curly and has volume so I never really did anything about it, it was easy to hide. I stopped the Spironolactone because it didn't help my HS, having no idea about its other benefits. Stressful times arose, hair suffered, started to see that bald shine and it was/is VERY noticeable. I researched, learned about spirono, called my derm and he put me back on, 75 mg a day. I kid you not people, my hair is showing regrowth already, few cm. Of course having alopecia a lot are the thin white hair that hopefully turn into thicker darker shafts but most are my natural color brown.  Its only been 2 months. I also use cold pressed castor oil and onion juice one the weekends. Started Nov. 22nd and today is Feb. 6 2018.

Spironolactone,  Gender Dysphoria," Worked great for a while, then I started losing weight, feeling tired, trouble swallowing, etc. My GP and the multiple specialists she sent me to told me it was an eating disorder and referred me to an eating disorder clinic...honestly don't trust MOST doctors after this. 

It turned out Spironolactone was the cause, because when I asked the Endocrinologist(not the one that originally prescribed Spiro for me) prescribing my meds to switch me to an alternative, the side effects went away and now I'm able to eat the same portions as those around me. 

if this medication works for you, great. But if you do start feeling unusually tired, bloated, can't eat, cant sleep and have trouble swallowing...GET OFF OF IT! It's not worth it.”",,"February 5, 2018",8
Spironolactone,  Acne," I'm 36 and have suffered painful big red ugly monthly cystic acne since the birth of my 2nd child at age 29. Usually the cysts take 1-2 weeks to stop hurting and 1 month to go away. However by my third day of spiro the cysts stopped being ""active"" and are significantly smaller. My chin is not as oily. I have only been on the medication 2 weeks and have not experienced any side effects and hopefully won't. I'm amazed at the results so far.”",10,"February 1, 2018",7
Spironolactone,  Acne," I was first perscribed Spironolactone when my hormonal acne was becoming devastating, around age 24. I would wake up every day with new cystic acne. I became very depressed and even missed work multiple times due to my breakouts.

I started taking a low dose of this drug around August 2012. After a few months, I did not notice much of a difference. Once my doctor increased the dose, I really started noticing significant results. It changed my life. 

Spironolactone would have had a faster effect if I identified by triggers sooner. I have found that B12 supplements and soy may still cause me to break out.”",9,"January 26, 2018",9
Spironolactone,  Acne, I’m 38 and started getting hormonal acne in my early 30’s with painful cysts that took weeks to go away. I tried so many OTC and prescribed topicals that never worked and sometimes made it worse. I finally went to the dermatologist in July and she put me on 100mg of Spiro. My face got so much worse in the beginning and I just wanted to quit! But I read the reviews and decided to be patient and give it time. I didn’t see results until a good 4 months after starting it. I’m now 6 months in and my skin is the clearest it’s been in years. I know it’s no fun but for me those few months of awful breakouts was so worth it! Be patient! It really does work!”,9,"January 20, 2018",14
Spironolactone,  Acne," I have been on spironolactone for about 2 months now due to cystic acne. Although a cyst on my face has not gone away yet, I do know it takes about 3 months for the medication to work. My skin has been relatively clear otherwise where I normally get severe breakouts. Although, I have had some strange side effects. My breasts have been extremely tender and have increased in size. I thought I had developed lumps in my breasts, so I went to my primary care and she told me the lumps were not abnormal and it was just my body reacting to the medication! I do recommend seeing your doctor if you have severe side effects. Otherwise, I have only experienced slight nausea and slight dizziness. I am on 50 mg twice a day.”",8,"January 3, 2018",2
Spironolactone,  Acne," I’ve been on it for about 3 years  and love a lot of what it does for my complexion. My skin used to be 90% cysts and blackheads but now I rarely get any flare ups. However, I did go through a really rough patch when I was learning to work with this medicine. I was extremely sensitive to light, had VERY dry skin, and had to limit my potassium intake. I worked out all the kinks and learned how to live with it. I do miss eating fries and everything else with potassium, but the pros outweigh the cons for me.”",8,"December 29, 2017",3
Spironolactone,  Acne," I have suffered from mild acne for as long as I can remember but when I turned 19 it got out of hand. I was waking up every day with 2-3 new whiteheads and cysts, most of the time being too painful to wash my face. I went to the dermatologist as soon as the pain started and was put on different creams and antibiotics for two months. In the span of that time my skin had gotten worse, leading me to the realization that there was something internally wrong with me. I was diagnosed with PCOS a few days later and put on spirolactone. I have been on this medication for 8 months and I kid you not my face has transformed for the better. What I would tell others who are contemplating getting off is to stay on and be persistent. It gets better!”",,"December 29, 2017",4
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," I've been under Spiro 100mg daily for 5 months for secondary hirsutism (I have congenital adrenal hyperplasia). I'm taking it combined with birth control and dexamethasone.... 
I can say that at the beginning the only thing I could notice was lightheaded, stomach ache and peeing a lot! 
My stomach was acting up for 2 months, took a while until a figure out how to effective get rid of the lightheaded sensation and my body ""adapts"" to the pee issue... I tried to change medication time and now at morning doses works out ok. 
It took 3 months until I notice my unwanted hair geting ""thinner"" and slowing growing. I still hairy af but I saw some improvements.

Spironolactone,  Hirsutism, I’m a 27 year old African American woman and I’ve been taking Spiro (100 mg) for hirtusim off and on for 4 years. I’d go off of it because it caused a significant amount of weight loss. I was already slim to begin with so weight loss was not something I could tolerate. But when the excessive hair growth came back about 6 months later I stayed on for another year. Fast forward to 4 years later weight loss is no longer an issue but I feel like the hair on top of my head is a lot thinner than it was before. Starting in January I’m thinking about taking Spiro in conjunction with Hairfinity. I’ll provide an update at the end of March! Wish me luck ladies”,8,"December 27, 2017",31
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," Hey so I am 25 hirsuitism sufferer, also have quite ‘male’ oily skin.My hair is a little on my jawline, chest, abdomen. No hormonal imbalances- been thoroughly tested. I first tried spiro a couple years ago and my doc put me on 50mg first then, as I was noticing change but couldn’t afford to get laser we upped to 100mg- this was for about 3-4 months. I started noticing that I was getting quite prominent leg veins. Stopped altogether (gradually ofc). Then.. found dianette- this works for me much more than Yasmin. Plus great boob growth. Figured after a while I would go back on Spironolactone with a 25mg dosage to boost effect. I also got a deal for laser because of my hirsuitism (just ask). Don’t get IPL- it burns skin- only go professional x”",10,"December 17, 2017",12
Spironolactone,  Alopecia, I have excessive hair loss and it’s been like that for months maybe a year now.  Anyway I first wanted to try natural stuff but it never stopped the hair loss. After months of hair loss I decided to ask my Doctor what medicine would reduce the hair loss caused by high testosterone and she gave me Spironolactone 50mg.  I have been googling about it before she gave it to me for months and based on people experience and the comments here I was excited like finally something would stop it. I only took it for 5 days and OMG the hair shedding I had in every day was crazy clumps and clumps. I stopped it and the crazy shedding was still there for two weeks. Plus I hardly get acne and I got like 5 spots in each cheek. Obviously people are different but it didn’t work for me”,1,"December 12, 2017",21

Spironolactone,  Acne," At first I thought this was a miracle drug because it cleared up my hormonal cystic acne FAST. My skin was flawless after just one month. However, the side effects were terrible. I was so lethargic I could barely do anything, I would sleep most of the day, always lightheaded, my cycle was completely out of whack, and I gained weight like crazy. I just didn’t feel right at all. When I went back to my doctor, she said Spiro can’t be the culprit of all my side effects (mainly the weight gain) and so she kept me on it, but lowered it from 100mg to 50mg. I disagreed and stopped taking it. After a week of being off of it, my energy & happiness totally returned. My skin is no longer perfect but I’d rather have acne than be fat and lifeless.”",3,"November 30, 2017",6
Spironolactone,  High Blood Pressure," I was prescribed Spironolactone 25 mg, to take with my  Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ 25 mg), for high blood pressure and low potassium levels. Just after I took Spironolactone with my HCTZ my BP was 136/77. Hours later I started having severe uncontrollable whole body tremors and bad headaches. I checked my BP and it was 167/84.  I checked BP 15 minutes later and it was 180/93! Spironolactone was stopped. I wonder if this raises cortisol levels.”",,"November 24, 2017",28
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," I have never written a review before but since I find reviews so helpful I figured I owed it to the universe to give back.  I started taking 25mg of Spironolactone twice a day for about two months for both excessive hair growth on my face AND for some hormonal acne.  I have been taking it in conjunction with laser hair removal and let me say it has been LIFE CHANGING.  I am not longer scared for someone to stand under me  or to have my bf touch my face.  I have been liberated from the chin hair dictator and I am so thankful.  Also, I have noticed a sizable improvement in my skin.  My derm suggests I up a dose to get full improvement in my skin and I am not taking 50mg twice a day.  I have had no noticeable side effects!  Highly recommend it”",10,"November 14, 2017",38
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," Been on this drug only for a week and I have noticed a decrease in facial hair. Started in conjunction with Ortho Cyclen though. Have had the following side effects —very  very tired, heartburn, nausea, lack of appetite, vivid dreams, and peeing A LOT

Spironolactone,  Alopecia," So I have been taking this medication for a little over a month for various reasons.  I have very thin hair and recently got worse...and also my acne.  I tend to break out here and there with small pimples in my chin but because I was stressing I got cystic acne.  It got so bad I wanted a doctor as soon as possible.  Within a week of taking the medication I noticed my skin clearing up...my cystic acne got smaller.  However I am noticing that I have lost significant weight ...almost 8 pounds already.  I am already thin so I didn't want to lose anymore.  I also had chills one day and even puked when I was on this medication.. This only occurred once so I figure it was fine. SO far it been ok , for hair I haven't noticed much difference yet”",7,"November 3, 2017",13

Spironolactone,  Acne," Honestly- I tried seriously every single OTC and prescription acne product there was to try. Both before and after I had a baby. I’m 24 and this is THE wonder drug. I’ve been taking spirinolactone for 7 months and I’m almost positive I never want to stop. I can tell you I had the worst cystic acne there ever was, every other day I had a new one and this went on for months where I wouldn’t even leave the house unless it was to get it injected- I’m also an avid picker and had terribly low self esteem . Anywho- if you’re able to take this medication— I would try because it might be the wonder drug for you too.”",10,"October 7, 2017",15
Spironolactone,  Acne," I had planned to write a lot more but it doesn't allow it. I had some devastating hormonal acne all around my jawline/neck area, basically the same area where a man would have a beard. I was never interested in taking Accutane due to the side effects but did some research and found Spironolactone *Aldactone as an apparent successful treatment. I've been taking it for 10 months now and my skin has never been better. I still get occasional pimples but I'm thankful for the drastic change. I started on 50mg ED for two weeks then upped it to 100mg ED for about 6 months or so and now I take a tablet (100mg) once to twice a week. I recommend it for anyone you legitimately has deep cystic hormonal acne that is on your face where a beard would grow.”",10,"October 5, 2017",5
Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," I began taking this medication by the recommendation of my OB/GYN. I have suffered from hirsutism for around 11 years with each year bringing more and more excess hair growth. MD informed me I need to be on a birth control if taking this medication due to possible severe injury to a fetus. After one month of being on this medication, I have noticed a significant decrease in the massive amount of dark, coarse hair I had growing on my chin, lip and sideburn area. I used to shave twice a day and have a panic attack if I forgot a shaving session, but now I only have to shave in the AM and by PM, there is very minimal growth noted. Definitely continuing this medication.”",,"September 20, 2017",28
Spironolactone,  Edema," I was on this for edema, and after awhile my legs got rashes  with like welts on my legs with water in them, plus it made a leg ulcer of mine look like I was burned, plus now off this I'm still have the welts full of water (blisters?),its very painfully, plus I'm dealing with the rash on my ankles!

Spironolactone,  Hirsutism," I'm a 23 year old girl who has struggled with acute hirsutism for years. It got so bad that I just resorted  shaving my face and neck daily after years of waxing, plucking, threading to no avail. The hair was so bad on my neck that I sometimes had to shave it twice a day, as it was in small clusters of course black hair. Needless to say, this all caused me a lot of grief. 

I can honestly say that spiro has worked so well for me, as I have been using it in conjunction with laser hair removal on my face (once every 3/4 weeks), as well as with Vaniqua cream (daily), which is the only topical medication for hiritusim that I'm aware of ..in Australia at least. The results have been amazing and I feel so much more confident in myself already!!”",,"September 18, 2017",24
Spironolactone,  Acne," I've been on Spironolactone for 1 monuth.
My face has some cystic acne yet, but it's ​now smaller than before.
Everyone says it takes ​time to get better...
You should wait at least 3 months​ to see the effects.

But the problem is my self confidence.
I think whenever​ I'm talking with someone, she just looks at my pimples.
If I work on self confidence, most of the problems would be solved automatically.
Even I wouldn't have any problem with my face.

Having acne isn't worse than other problems like Cancer or sickness.

Spironolactone,  Acne, Because I wanted results and I wanted them fast. I turned to all of the natural products to cure acne like apple cider vinegar and rose water and tea tree oil etc. Honestly I can for sure tell you I was making my skin worse. I was like heavily exfoliating every night and then putting hella oils on my skin and I didn't even know I was ruining it. My skin got super bad around finals and then didn't really get much better until spring break but then it bounced back and was worse than ever. It was the worst it's ever been at the beginning of summer so I went to the derm finally and got this stuff and no joke I haven't seen a zit on my face in so long it's just scars and my skin is like glowy just honestly try this it works 10/10 fam.”,9,"September 10, 2017",23

My acne became worst, like it was the only thing people focus on when I'm talking to them. I became hopeless and depressed. I searched online and found out about SPiro so I gave it a shot. Started on 50mg for 1 month then I'm on 100mg now. I'm on my 10th month on Spiro this week. I just noticed a few changes like my back acne clearing up, yet my facial acne (around 20pcs) is still there.

I'm in day 25 of Efudex treatment, stopped applying the cream after 21 days.  My face is very red and itchy, it's amazing how the cream identifies areas of damage.  It's been tough at times, sleepless nights with burning/itching.  Strangely when I stopped applying the cream I suffered stomach acid, unsure if its relayed.  The biggest challenge is to persevere to the end.  I use Aquaphore from Amazon to soothe the itching.  Good luck to everyone!”",10,"November 9, 2020",11
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," My GP saw some actinic keratosis on my head and said I should mention this at my appointment a dermatologist.

 I am using fluorouracil  5% .The regime was 4 weeks  once a day, followed by 3 weeks healing followed  by 4 weeks. The 2nd treatment is  to reveal and fix any actinic keratosis missed in the first.
I have nearly finished the ALL treatment,  on my head - I am bald.  I am 78 years old. The treatment on the head was itchy and  at the end  painful- the 2nd treatment did not show any remaining AKs.  I could see that some of the 'rash' raised by the drug extended to my face so I started a treatment there. This was  more painful - particularly round the mouth and cheeks as these move if you smile or speak. I am in the healing phase now and will start a second treatment in 2 weeks.

Efudex,  Skin Cancer," After completing my EFUDEX treatment my skin seemed to get better and then it turned out to get worse and worse, red spots where I had applied the cream. My doctor could not understand
why and prescribed me cortisone cream, which turned out to be much worse.
Another doctor said I am cancer free but from now on I have constantly broken capillaries on my face and I am not able to do any inversions or put my head down. My skin is still irritated after 6 months that I stopped using Efudex.

I was anxious with all the reviews I read but think it’s important to remind ones that everyone is different. The last day and night after finishing has been the most painful. I’m
Putting 1% hydrocortisone on in ointment form. Keeps area oily   Some benefits of COVID are mask wearing. With hat sunnies and mask I can go out and people don’t notice how hideous I look. Taking pain relievers to sleep. Itching, burning at night is worst. 
I’m a runner and I’ve continued all the way thru but will see what the next few days brings.”",9,"October 13, 2020",18
Efudex,  Keratosis," I am a 70 year old woman originally  from Britain..used efudex on chin, side of nose and cheek. Went up a little too close to corner of my eye  which  swelled up. I used twice  a  day  for 15 days which was enough to bear. Big crusty scab on chin. Very sore itchy and burning. Can't do the other side of nose  as too painful.”",10,"September 26, 2020",11
Efudex,  Skin Cancer," I have been using the Efudex cream for 10 days now. I have come out in red spots on my face but I am in no pain, as yet. I am wondering if I am using it correctly.  The blotchy spots are crimson but not sore. Will it get worse because I was scared to use it but so far so good as far as pain is concerned. I do look weird though with these red spots everywhere.”",6,"August 27, 2020",25
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," My dermatologist said apply on face twice daily for 10-12 days.  Well, my skin is super sensitive.  After 2 days I was red, itching, and in pain, so I stopped at the end of day 5.  I’m at day 9 and look like I have severe sunburn with scaling, pealing, oozing, and burning.  I am hopeful I’m about to turn a corner toward clearing up.  Argh!  It worked great on my legs after 2 week’s treatment.  My facial skin, another story.”",9,"August 18, 2020",19
Efudex,  Basal Cell Carcinoma," Ten years ago I used Aldara over my whole face. 20 minutes of pain after each application and a violent reaction after 9 days. Face looked as though I had been in a bad fire and scared the kids at school. It did heal and I looked 10 years younger.

I have just finished 3 weeks on Efudex and 3 weeks healing. Skin looks like the proverbial babies bottom and very happy with the results. This time I treated whole face, ears and parts of neck. Applying the Efudex was less painful than the Aldara, even a little bit soothing. Hard to sleep with sore ears. Tried all kinds of moisturisers and they caused stinging for 5-10 minutes. Used vaseline 2-3 times daily and it was by far the most satisfactory. Very pleased with the results. Also treated both arms at the same time. Used 3 tubes of Efudex on this session. Always worked outside and lots of boating. 76 years young now after this treatment.”",10,"August 8, 2020",19
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I so appreciate all your comments.  I am day 21 of Efudex and my GP wants me to keep going another week.  I am applying to my nose, hands and forearms.  My nose is a beacon as is the area around it.  Thank goodness for COVID isolation as it couldn’t be happening at a better time.  I was going to stop today but after reading everyone’s experience I will keep going for another week.  Thank you”",9,"July 29, 2020",27
Efudex,  Skin Cancer," Being a white Aussie girl who loved being outside my skin was a mess. I’m now 58. I’ve used Efudex several years ago with great success. 
Started again due to scaley patches on face that never went away. These reacted instantly and then disappeared. After having a break started using on pigmentations on my face. These too reacted, interestingly I started getting reactions on places I didn’t put the cream. So I started putting the cream there too. 
My face is a mess, very itchy, sore.  
I certainly wouldn’t recommend using this on large areas at a time due to the uncomfortableness of the process. 
I know it will be worth it, so I will continue on. 
I have some lumps on my head, once my face is done I will be doing my scalp.”",9,"July 27, 2020",14
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," Body is covered with skin eruptions . Used Efudex for 2 weeks on right cheek.  Using Bioderm. Does not seem to be helping . 7 weeks since treatment. Seeing dermatologist, did biopsy, on prednisone. Where to go ?
Apparently there are still cells on my cheek after efudex. Very scary drug ! Face is still healing, not sure how long it will take. Effectiveness unknown at this time.”",1,"July 25, 2020",10
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," Male 52, having had ongoing AK issues on scalp and face, regularly frozen with dry ice over past several years. Started using Efudex 2x daily on scalp for past 3 weeks; some mild irritation but not at all problematic; after 2 weeks crusty areas fell away (I did slightly agitate which I know I shouldn't) and will continue to use for another 1-2 weeks. So far so good, material improvement in scalp and tenderness has subsided substantially. Now starting to try small area on forehead below hairline, before doing entire face...just to see if reaction is very different, but this is just SO much better than having intermittent freezing. Will definitely do a second cycle on scalp after a break. Highly recommend based on 3 weeks' usage. Will update further after using on face. Thanks for all the other posts !”",,"June 8, 2020",32
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I am 70, with chestnut hair, fair skin and blue eyes. My doctor diagnosed actinic keratosis on a small lesion on my face. He recommended Efudix twice a day for 3 weeks. I used a cotton bud to apply the cream as it seemed easier to apply it thinly that way than with my finger. During the first two weeks the lesion started to become red and enlarged slightly. Towards the end of the second and throughout the third week yellowy crusts started to form and the lesion felt tender and raw. If I went out in the sun I put a small plaster over it for protection. After the treatment a scab formed over the whole area that took two weeks to fall off. Then new skin appeared and I have been applying Calendula to aid the recovery. I am left with a pink streak which hopefully will fade with time. Until then I will use a 'hide the blemish' make-up which I would think a man could also use, if need be. Overall very pleased with the result.”",10,"May 29, 2020",27
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I am on my 18th day of using Efudix.  I am only using on my tip of nose.  This morning a horrible crusty scab of blistering came off and it is now red and raw.  I am still using as I was told to stop on day 21.  I am seeing my doctor tomorrow to see how things are going and whether I should carry on for longer.  No pain, just a sort tingling and look like Rudolph the Reindeer, but coping fine.  Sleep well and no real side affects.”",8,"May 25, 2020",22
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I am on day 15 of the Efudex cream. I was terrified to start. I was actually prescribed the cream two other times and chickened out due to the photos that I had seen on YouTube. I am doing very well so far. It is super tight and red around my mouth, very hard to smile. I have spots all over my forehead and a few on my cheeks. It’s always a shock to see my face in the mirror. But without looking at myself it feels like I put on one of those peel off face masks just tight. So far I sleep just fine. I don’t however use Vaseline I use calendula it’s for burns and has worked well. I have also used makeup when I had to go out in public. It is definitely convenient being in lockdown because everyone is wearing a mask so it hides my super red chin. I have  6 more days of cream, I am taking this one day at a time. The only side effect so far that I have had is two different days I felt extremely tired.”",8,"May 15, 2020",29
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I chose to apply my treatment over 2 periods separated by 6 months.  half of face and right arm this time and in 6 months will do the other half.  53 years old, scottish descent growing up in Queensland, Australia. Too late to chip my parents about that. Skin: Fitzpatrick Type 1.
I had a good (severe) reaction within 3 days, applying three times per day against the advice of 2 times per day.  Within 1 week, yellowish crusting, weeping etc. kept it up for two weeks in total, then stopped and another 2 weeks to recover.  Good result.  Pain intense, and I was fortunate enough to have a GP that prescribed some decent pain killers and a mild sedative (5mg Diazepam) to help me get through the night. Tried to persevere without the drugs but they proved to be a god send,.  Would recommend to do this treatment in Winter and off work or working from home. (Trivial note: started treatment at the same time as working from home due to Covid-19)”",9,"May 8, 2020",24

Efudex,  Keratosis," This is my second time around for using efudex. The first time was 6 years ago. I've grown up on the West coast and spent my summers in the deserts or at the beach. I am of Irish descent, brown hair, blue eyes. By the time I was 60, my face looked terrible. High danger for skin cancer, many trips to dermatologist.

Began to hurt significantly on day 14. Everything I read and saw on the web said ""stick it out"". I made it to day 25, Couldn't do another minute.

Dragged myself into the doc's office on a Friday afternoon. I looked like Frankenstein. Appt's clerk gasped. Doc said ""Great job. Looks like it was very effective.""

That night I washed everything off, and applied Aquaphor. Next two days were most painful. After that, it got better every day, and within two months, there was no trace of the 40 years of sun damage on my face. So...I would give this a 10. I'm a teacher, and did the treatment over the winter holidays. It was all done by January 7”",10,"May 2, 2020",47
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I grew up in Canberra, Australia. Sunburn every year, never wore a hat, didn't know about sunburn cream. I started using Efudex when I was 38. I'm on my fourth facial using it. I can last 16 days at the most. I would be so painful if I used it for 28 days. I know it's time to stop when it is so itchy that I don't get a single minute of sleep at night. I have to stay at home for 3 or 4 weeks - I scare too many people otherwise.  Before bed I have to take mild sleeping tablets (Restavit) and ibuprofen. I used to use Lucas Pawpaw ointment at night, but it's too thick and itchy.  I use Dermeze treatment ointment. Lucas' is good for recovery. I have to wash the Efudex off before I go to sleep - otherwise I can feel its horrible burning all night. If I accidentally touch the treated spot and then rub my eyes, they get swollen for days. I hate the treatment (0/10) - torturers could use it.  But I love the results (10/10). My skin feels so good for 4 years.”",7,"May 1, 2020",18
Efudex,  Keratosis," I'm a 68 year old male.
This is the second time I have used this fabulous cream.
Enjoy the results, YES!
Enjoy the experience, NO!
I applied the cream twice a day to my entire face for two weeks. After two further weeks, all of the scabbing has gone and my face has peeled. Still a few weeks to go before the worst of the redness goes.
I must be honest - the pain was bad: Burning sensation, needle pricks, scabbing and blood spots on my pillow.
Sometimes it was so bad, I had to ease the pain with ice.
But all of the pain described above was worth it.
The cream detects the worst affected areas - some I had no idea were damaged.
It leaves the undamaged skin alone.
This cream has reduced my number of visits to the seriously expensive dermatologist to almost zero.
My skin feels and looks twenty years younger.
I cannot recommend this cream enough, You should be thrilled with the results.
But, as with most rewards in life, there is some serious pain involved.”",10,"April 25, 2020",45
Efudex,  Basal Cell Carcinoma," I am up to my last day of treatment, day 21. I have treated my entire face once a day with efudix and would never do it again. After the first couple of days red spots start to appear, after a week my face looked like a severe case of sunburn and felt like it. The intensity of the redness increased along with constant burning. By day 12 I wad ready to give up but reminded myself I was over half way. I didn't know how I could bear to apply more efudix but perseverance and willpower has been on my side.
It is a painful experience which I would only recommend  as a last resort.
Even today I dread putting the cream on for the last time but after that I know each day will be a slow pace of healing. I look forward to the end result and hope all the discomfort is worth it”",,"April 20, 2020",26
Efudex,  Basal Cell Carcinoma," I'm 69 and using Efudex for the second time. Just as in 2008, I have been recommended for 21 days of Efudex cream, 2 applications per day, followed by 21 days of twice a day applications of Desonide 0.05%.
I am applying the cream broadly on my forehead back to my receded hairline, my sideburn area and my nose. After the first week most areas turned blotchy red and grew increasingly sore and itchy. I have experienced mild stomach upset and my face feels hot.  It started to effect my ability to sleep around day 16. Almost packed it in on day 19 but read these posts and decided to persevere for 3 more days. It worked very well back in 2008 and I'm looking forward to the ordeal ending and getting similarly good results.”",10,"April 12, 2020",16
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I spent years in the sun scuba diving and hiking in Mexico and Arizona. For years I've constantly had to use lip balm because my lips were so dry. I tried many products and they never worked. My lips would crack and peel all the time. Just recently I got diagnosed with Actinic Chelitis. I have been prescribed a Effudex 5% once a day for 3 to 4 weeks. I am at Week 2 and experiencing severe, almost unbearable, burning pain because of deep sores with massive amounts of oozing and crusting and now bleeding, tightness and severe dryness. I will try to endure another week but I think I would rather surgery any day than this.”",3,"April 8, 2020",22
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I used Flouroplex about 15 years ago on my chest and face, they were both a mess for 5-6 weeks, but the treatment is worth is.  I started seeing the same damage on my chest and face and my DR prescribed Efudex 5%.  It works the same and when I spread it on the chest little red spots started showing, then more and more. I look like my chest has the measles. Some are large spots that swell and ooze.  It is very itchy with prickly pain, now in the third week, hard to sleep. I'm going to stop at the weeks end for a full 4 weeks. I also treated some specific spots on the side of my face but it just got very red, turned blackish, I stopped that at 3 weeks and it is healing nicely with the help of vaseline.  I have not had any side effects with vomiting or headaches as others have reported.  Once my chest starts healing I'm going to try some additional spots on my face.  It is not pleasant but what chemo treatment would be?  The alternative is surgery.”",10,"April 7, 2020",23
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," Was told to use efudex 5%  2x's/day for 2 or 3 weeks, but pain would not let me do that.  Used  it for only 4 days and had a serious reaction to it.  Had raised redness over 3/4 of my face, like welts.  Had stinging and pain at 4 days & Dr. said that 4 days was enough.  Unusually fast reaction.  Now I want to see how long it will take to get back to normal.  Today is day 5.  My sister & bro in law have also used it with good results.”",10,"March 20, 2020",15
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I am on Efudex for a few spots of actinic keratosis on my face.  I am on day 15 and was prescribed to stay on it for 21 days .  My face is raw, swollen , and monstrous looking I feel like it’s super glued.  I’m gonna do my best to stick it out for the next six days.  Like many others, my doctor did not tell me about the intense pain and scary look.  However my father-in-law was on the cream a few years ago so I knew what I was in for.  I also went through photo light therapy 12 years ago where that result was immediate, threw up on the way home from the pain.  Efudux has the same pain , just a long drawn out process to get there.”",7,"March 12, 2020",20
Efudex,  Basal Cell Carcinoma," Face was covered in about 7 areas after years of sun damage from working in the sun, used Efudex for 15 days applied 2 times a day till the 40mgs tube ran out , week 2 the pain was not nice but honestly go thought it it is worth it ,
Like having a face lift looking 10 years younger !!! Believe me it is truth .
Using it on my arms now just started 
For any one going though a course, it really is impressive cream”",10,"January 31, 2020",41
Efudex,  Keratosis," Dermatologist prescribed efudex for keratosis 1 week on and 3 weeks off x 4 to treat my face but said not to apply on chin.  After a few days freckles appeared and by day 7 today my skin feels quite irritated, itchy and a slight sting - especially the sides of my nose.  One spot above my eyebrow has bled slightly last night and tonight after washing my face.  My dermatologist said I could continue to wear foundation but to wait 15 mins after applying cream.”",9,"January 27, 2020",25
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I am grateful for Efudex, although the treatment is quite difficult, because it is effective, comprehensive and empowering! Skin cancer surgeries are another kind of difficult I hope to avoid! I’ve used Efudex three times on my face...the first two weeks are the easiest, the second two are more challenging. Plan to stay at home week 4 and the first week of healing. If you are using around your mouth, it will be hard to comfortably eat and drink. Eat soft foods and use a straw. With supervision, my doctor directed me to use Efudex on my lips, which was the most challenging of all applications! Because lips are a more sensitive area, I only needed to apply for 7-10 days....I made it to 8 and could do no more. No doubt Efudex is challenging to use, but it beats multiple surgeries where hunks of your face are removed! I plan to use in the future where issues emerge....because the  bad” cancer causing cells will keep appearing. And, now I can do something when they do!”",10,"January 20, 2020",34
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I was prescribed Efudex for basal carcinoma on my leg. Used twice a day for 3 weeks.  Excellent result. Now 6 weeks on and just left with red area which I assume will fade with time.  I was also told to treat AK on my face, used cream once a day for 4 weeks (stopped 3 days short).  As with other comments made, I was not informed by the dr that I would look absolutely monstrous.  Immediate reddening of the entire face, followed by scabbing.  Still at the scabbing stage. I could get a part in a horror movie. The cream seemed to migrate towards my eyes where I had not applied it.   Would I have used Efudix if I had known what I would look like - probably wouldn’t have had the courage as people stare when I am out and about. Determined to continue with my life as normal.  Think it’s better than it turning into cancer at a later stage.  I await the results with bated breath, although I think this may be many months away.”",7,"January 18, 2020",33
Efudex,  Skin Cancer," Two weeks after efudex and my skin looked incredible - soft and everyone asked if I got a peel! 1 day later day 15 there was burn abrasions, raised cuts and I went to my scheduled two week check in with dr and she said it’s  working Beautifully” and continue for two more weeks. 
During week 3 I had small  cuts” all over my face where I applied cream 2x a day. Small scabby cuts also appeared on my scalp, chest even though I didn’t apply the medication there. The dr said that was strange, but I read in the leaflet it’s plausible. Horrible taste in mouth and sick to my stomach within 20 min of applying still. I’m in horrible pain, look awful and two more weeks to go. Had SCC with two Mohs surgery then reconstruction of Nose and head earlier last year. I'm 47  years old and grew up in  cal sun. Hope this prevents future SSC”",8,"January 18, 2020",28
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis, I am using efudex and the spots were getting raised and crusty as expected but then it got damp in the shower and came off with a bit of bleeding.

Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I had a very tiny split on the side of my nose that wouldn’t heal. It was BCC.  It was surgically removed.  One of the most horrible experiences, emotionally.  I used Efudex a year ago for a spot that appeared on my chest.  It worked well, although painful and itchy.  I am now using it on my forehead, nose and upper lip area.  I was shocked at how many spots appeared!  Extremely painful when touched, but otherwise just a little itchy on occasion.  I am grateful for all the comments here....it gives me courage to keep going.  Week 2.....”",7,"January 8, 2020",30

Efudex,  Basal Cell Carcinoma," I was prescribed this cream to treat BCC on my nose.  I had a red spot with suspected basal cell carcinoma. My dermatologist wanted me to treat my entire nose, to get any spots that hadn't emerged yet.  I put on twice daily for two weeks.  It took about a week for anything to happen, but then the spot turned red.  Soon my entire nose turned pink.  At day 14 my nose was red, with purple areas, blisters, and depressions.  I had to put Vaseline on it to tolerate the pain.  It felt like someone had burned my face with a hot iron. The skin was pulled taught and I was afraid of scarring. It has been 8 weeks after the application stopped.  It is still a little pink.  Unfortunately it did not get my spot, it is not superficial enough.  The cream redness lasts longer for me than I anticipated.   It was an 8 week process for me and still have a pink nose. hope it isn't permanent.”",8,"December 20, 2019",35
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis, Was prescribed Efudix by the NHS to treat incorrectly diagnosed psoriasis (they thought it was Actinic Keratosis because I have AC on arms/hands from growing up in a hot country) on my ankle. Used the cream for 6 weeks roughly in 2018 and stopped using the cream after the 6 weeks. Developed a case of Discoid Eczema which originated from the psoriasis spot and I've had now for a year. Have to apply Epimax cream twice a day to contain the eczema which is incredibly/unbearably itchy and causes red welts to appear on my legs below and on the knees. If you have a choice I would not use Efudix.”,1,"December 7, 2019",12
Efudex,  Keratosis, Efudex was extremely painful. It affects cancer spots. Well  I guess that is all over because my entire body was inflamed.”,4,"November 10, 2019",19
Efudex,  Keratosis," Put it on the obvious parts of my face that I thought needed to be treated, found that the Efudix somehow seeped to cover much more of my face, had lots of redness followed by crusty scabbing, had to stop treatment after just short of 3 weeks as my eye were in agony with stinging gritty feeling, even though I didn't put any anywhere near my eyes - wonder if gets into sinus system and makes its way there.”",9,"October 29, 2019",55
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," Had to stop using Efudix on my face after 2 weeks and 2 days because of pain, dizziness, and mouth sores. My face was a fright, bright red all over as the cream seemed to creep"" when used . One week later the rash has settled and the pain has subsided but I fear it will be weeks before I return to my normal look. I have dry flakey scabs on my face where scabs were not evident before Efudix. I regret using this cream on my face.

My chest looks like I have been blasted with both barrels of a shotgun. Red welts everywhere as I  dressed the whole area with Efudix as advised by DR. Not really painful but starting to itch. I am 3 weeks into this area, I feel I could stop now but will give it a few more days.

The jury is still out.................”",3,"October 23, 2019",27
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I am a 60 year old with very fair skin and blue eyes who grew up at the beach. I was regularly burned to a blister stage every year.
I had  many keratosis burned off from age 30 to 50. Finally advised to use Efudex. I have completed treatments on my face 5 times now over the course of these 10 years.
I have an unusually mild reaction each time. In fact, I have to use it for 40 days to get the full benefit. So, you never know how your own skin will react. The dermatologists have been amazed at the length of time it takes me to get a reaction. But for the chest area, the reaction is incredibly painful, red, and fast. Maybe the constant freezing of those places on my face helped more than I know?
In any case, Maybe it could be recommended to try a small area before using on the entire face.
The end results are very good and I would not let fear keep you from trying this.”",10,"October 19, 2019",58
Efudex,  Keratosis," Been using Efudex for 3 weeks now applying it nightly on a small spot on the left cheek, the area of skin been scaly now really red and has spread to double the size , I have stopped applying it as the soreness has gone and will wait a month to see if it clears , the treatment gave me a funny taste , dicky tummy and terrible itching on my back for ten mins after a bath or shower , scored 5 at the moment because my cheek looks a mess with the redness but hope it will clear over the coming weeks , applying sudacrem hope it helps !”",6,"October 9, 2019",34
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," Used for 4 weeks to treat what physician thought might be an AK  (Actinic Keratosis) - a very tiny dry scaly spot above my upper lip.  Efudex was easy to use, not painful, just a gnarly scab that took weeks to fall off. Once gone, the skin was smooth but red. Red spot was 3X larger than the AK being treated (now the size of a pencil eraser).   Hoping the redness will heal in time. Finished treatment two months ago but the smooth red splotch remains. It looks far worse than the tiny dry spot I had before I began treatment. Regret using Efudex”",3,"October 3, 2019",28
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," Growing up at the Jersey Shore and summers spent at Fl Beaches, I fell in love with the warmth of the sun, and a healthy tan. At 55, the sun made my chest bubble up, and my legs reverse tan.  It is no surprise that I had actinic keratosis multiplying fast. I was prescribed Efudex 5% for my chest, neck and face. I had no idea it was topical Chemo. What? I googled everything Efudux, bought Aveeno, vanicreme, Aquaphor, asked for anxiety med for my mounting fears and took a personal leave from work. Its Day 13, saw Dr., I'm done. I did look beat up. In the afternoon insane itching.. tap tap.  Many more dead lesions, surface and crust up.  I'm using cortizone,  and aquaphor on the corners and for lesions around my lips.  I will be doing this for years to come peeling back the many layers of damage. It has not been as bad as it was for others. It's uncomfortable yet tolerable, and much better than the alternative. The knife or Cancer. Oddly, I feel healthier and fortunate to be given this chance.”",8,"September 13, 2019",50
Efudex,  Keratosis," Treatment with efudex on both arms for keratosis, caused damage, had bad reaction creating auto-immunity situation; still being treated by dermatologist after 12 months. Itching unbearable on arms, bleeding after scratching and left with watery mess. Relief from ice-packs help and then moisturising. Treatment from Prednisolone, Cyclosporin lasts for a few weeks and then I break out again. Been around this way 6 times now! Efudex: seek all the info you can before treatment.”",1,"August 27, 2019",38
Efudex,  Basal Cell Carcinoma," I've had surgery for basal cell over the years and had an area near my nose. I used efudex as directed. Sure, it looked horrible after treatment it was a bit lumpy like it was scarred. I thought it didn't work. The area, came back totally cancer free and the lumpy look went away. 
You would never know it was treated. Well worth it. I'm currently using it on my cheek and hoping for the same result.

Efudex,  Skin Cancer," Used Efudex on my whole face 10 years ago. I think it was for 4 weeks. Week 2 the redness turned into lesions on my whole face , especially my left side (drivers side).
Hurt like hell. I play poker sometimes at a casino. I didn't have to look at me so my appearance wasn't my problem.
After the lesions healed my face was as smooth as  a baby's butt.  A couple of the players were surprised I was still alive because I looked like I had full blown aids. I recommend it as I had no idea my face was such a mess. It is an ordeal.
Using it on my ear now. started 6 weeks ago and in the last few days.  Fingers crossed. Not pleasant but hopefully I can avoid surgery and plastic surgery .”",9,"August 7, 2019",33
Efudex,  Skin Cancer," This cream should be banned. After using it for three weeks I had a bad reaction to it. I have lost my taste and my skin has a terrible rash. Three weeks since I stopped using it I still have no taste. My life is ruined if my taste doesn’t come back. :( 
Do not use”",1,"July 17, 2019",24
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," One of the most painful experiences of my entire life. I thought childbirth was the worse pain I ever experienced,  but this pain is indescribable. I'm at 5 weeks now. Hope to come off soon. Just opening my mouth to try  eat is excruciating. My Dr never warned me about any of this, nor did he tell me I was going to look like a monster.”",10,"March 3, 2019",50
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," After years of sun damage, my whole face lit up like a Christmas tree full of red lights within 1 week of twice daily application. 

Shaving: No problem. Use a sharp razor and light pressure with a mild gel cream

Washing: Try Simple Water Boost Micellar facial gel wash. Great stuff. cleans your face and does not leave it dry OR oily. Does not irritate the burning skin. Still use it every day to clean my face.

Lubrication: Try Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel. Not cheap, but you don't need much. Worked great, no greasy feeling. Used a chilled aloe mask at night during last week. 

Timeline: Should be able to finish in 3 weeks of twice daily.  Still pretty bad for a week after treatment with first 2 layers of skin dried up and peeled away. Had another 2 weeks of peelings. After that, skin was super smooth but still red in some areas. Took another month for most of that to fade away. 

Definitely recommend using Efudex. It's obviously not fun, but produces great results.”",10,"January 18, 2019",62
Efudex,  Skin Cancer, I was prescribed efudex for squamous carcinoma. Was told to do both arms from elbow to fingers. One at a time of course. I'm just over three weeks of using it and it has not worked at all. Doctor can't understand why.”,1,"September 26, 2018",23
Efudex,  Keratosis, Have been using efudex now for two weeks. I have been putting my regular moisturizer on every day and my skin stays soft. I use pure Shea butter.  Having a little itching but not bad. I thought users might try Shea butter to help keep the area moist.”,7,"August 1, 2018",51
Efudex,  Basal Cell Carcinoma," Just got done using this for a superficial Basal Cell on my nose.  Week 1 wasn't bad, just a little redness and irritation at the end.  By the end of week 2, it was red and very itchy.  I can't say it was ever very ""painful"", just uncomfortable and irritated.  It has felt like something crawling across my face/nose since end of week 2, and itchy.  Lots of trouble getting to sleep because of this.  2 weeks once a day, 3 weeks twice a day.  It's still red and very itchy and I'm told will be for another week or two.  Now I wait for follow-up.”",9,"May 31, 2018",30

Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I was misdiagnosed by a dermatologist as having A.K. when actually I had eczema. Efudex turned my arm into a raw ulcerated painful itchy oozing mess. Unable to sleep. Application was for two weeks only, then discontinued. After recovering from the treatment, the eczema was still there.  I changed doctors.  One application of  a medium strength corticosteroid, itching gone, healing started.  Please get multiple opinions about the disease you have, and the treatment options before being told to use efudex.”",10,"April 22, 2018",31
Efudex,  Skin Cancer," At 65yo and lifetime in the sun and numerous treatments including surgery, cryotherapy etc Doctor said will have to use Efudix to whole face as had untold AK's plus Bowens Disease. Told it was a ''brutal'' treatment. He was right.
All I can say is that this treatment was the most painfull experience in my life. By week two I was in agony but forced myself to continue the three week treatment. A word of warning. Under no circumstances get this stuff on your genitals. I did and it was agonising. Pain so intense sent me into depression for 3 months. Results were excellent however and no regrets.”",10,"November 16, 2017",40
Efudex,  Keratosis," I was diagnosed with actinic keratosis in August and then decided to apply the Efudex cream to face in the middle of September. 
I thought that I only had a couple of spots which I was concerned about but after applying the cream to my forehead, temples, cheeks, nose, around the eyes and my ears it became quite apparent that there were a vast amount of areas that had been affected.
In the First week I saw that these areas became inflamed although not painful.
In the  second week these areas started to merge together and then look like blisters and sores on my face, especially below my eyes.
In the third week these started to scab a little and became a bit painful I think due to the skin feeling very dry. I am now in my fourth and final week”",10,"October 7, 2017",73
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis, I have a question not comment please. I'm on day 6 if 14 days application. No reaction. Is this normal? I'm applying  thin layer 2 times a day. Am I doing  something wrong or us this normal?”,,"September 17, 2017",66
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis, I had a small spot on nose. Used this twice a date for 14 days. Spot became very red and got scabby where the precancer is on skin. After 14 days stopped treatment. Now in healing process. Using Vaseline twice day. Scabs are showing coming off on own. DON'T PEEL. AREA very red but becoming less a bit. I hear it takes a few weeks for the redness to subside. So far so good. Not too much discomfort.  I did get depressed doing this though as it's my face and I didn't want you go in public.”,,"August 17, 2017",39
Efudex,  Keratosis, Have applied for three weeks once a day. Increased to twice this last week. MY face is quite red and sore and I am amazed at how many spots have come out. Will continue for a few more days. This site has encouraged me. I wasn't sure whether to keep going.”,8,"August 4, 2017",46
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I used efudix for 20 days. Got all the bearable symptoms of rash, redness and sore skin. It took about 2 months for the redness to go completely.

The main long lasting side effect I have is that it's been six months and I still have permanently very greasy, greasy skin on my nose and cheeks where I applied it. 
TIP, make sure you are not prone to rosacea before using it. I didn't know I was prone but the efudix triggered the adult rosacea I never knew I had. (rosacea is like acne, it comes and goes but only in the place where I used the efudix, it's embarrassing and I don't like going in public during flare ups.)

I wouldn't recommend this treatment at all. It might be ok on small 2cm spot treatments on the body, NOT THE FACE. Beware”",2,"March 31, 2017",41
Efudex,  Basal Cell Carcinoma," I have basil carcinoma of my face cheeks and face had lumps. I have Scottish skin. Started Efidux treatment and after day 3 I became violently ill. For 10 days I couldn't hold any food down what ever. Both exit body points were hammered with oozing duck poo like stuff I have never experienced before. Bloated stomach, gas build up and always on the toilet. After day 10 the systems eased and I started to hold some food down. Currently on day 16 of treatment an day face looks like an iron has been applied to both FACE CHEEKS. Very painful and still feel unwell. This better work because I have researched this product before commencing and there were no side affects listed like I have had. Met another patient of efidex with similar side effects.”",5,"October 20, 2016",36
Efudex,  Keratosis," Have used it for pre-cancer on my face probably 6 times since 1996. 
Using it now on a couple of spots on the back of my hand. 
Have always found it perfectly effective. Yes, after a couple weeks it begins to look raw and ugly, but that quickly clears up after treatment stops. In every case the spots were cured. Luckily I have never experienced any of the pain or itchiness that others have reported. Perhaps mostly the ones who had problems bothered to report?
And I still have the original tube of the produce I got back in 1996, and yes, it still works. There was enough in it to keep me going when needed it and obviously it didn't go bad. The fact it's in a metal tube may have enabled it's long life vs a plastic tube.”",10,"August 30, 2016",121
Efudex,  Basal Cell Carcinoma, I have BCC on my upper arm and SCC on upper left hand. Unfortunately after 6wks of treatment twice a day the cream didnt work. So disappointed and im now scheduled to have both surgically removed.”,1,"August 30, 2016",28
Efudex,  Basal Cell Carcinoma," I had a small lump removed from below my lip, and was prescribed efudex to be applied twice a day for four weeks. I have just finished that time, so I don't know how effective it has been. I had no reaction for 9 days, then my lip became very swollen and weepy, cracked in the corner. My GP suggested that I put vaseline around the spot before applying the cream, and that helped the lips considerably.  I changed to paw-paw cream, which seemed to help. Now it is six days since I stopped applying the cream and I still have what looks like a large cold sore, as well as the red crustiness under my nose which started only when I stopped the efudex. I am hoping this may go soon. I am not sure whether to put anything on them or not.”",7,"August 21, 2016",33
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," Dear the a: I have widespread actinic keratosis on my forearms. I was prescribed Efudex. I have thin, fair skin and some freckling. The damage seems to have occurred from a childhood playing outdoors, before sunscreen became so important. The Efudex, astonishingly, did nothing. So very disappointing. The dermatologist was equally surprised, and prescribed another round. Still nothing. And no one can give me an answer.  I am now considering a chemical peel or whatever the next step might be. So very tired of hiding my arms. Good luck to you. If anyone can give you an answer, please, please post it here.”",1,"July 28, 2016",40
Efudex,  Basal Cell Carcinoma," This is my third time over the past 10 years doing this treatment.  I'm scheduled for 4-6 weeks treating my legs, stomach and chest areas.  I like that the medication seeks out and treats damaged skin only.  My stomach has only 3 small spots.  However my legs and chest area that have been far more exposed to sun have a much more aggressive reaction. The pain, redness, swelling and sores are extremely painful however my history reminds me that in 3-4 weeks I will be finished and my skin will look and be much better.  Skin cancer gone and baby smooth new skin. It's affordable, and a more complete overall treatment that definitely works.  Stick with the plan you don't be disappointed !!”",10,"May 2, 2016",103
Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I was prescribed Efudex to treat various Actinic Keratoses on my forehead and balding front pate. Firstly my overall rating is that the treatment is very effective and I now have a beautiful forehead of smooth skin after 2 weeks 2 days of treatment and 2 weeks of recovery post treatment.

It may be that my skin damage was mild. In any event I found the process quite bearable.I applied the cream sparingly night and morning and there was little to see for 3 or 4 days, skin then reddened and peeled/flaked - no ulceration or discharge. Although unsightly (looked like a bright rash) as a male I was still happy to go out and socialise. I used my wife's hair colourant  plastic protective gloves but still washed hands thoroughly after use. Happy.”",9,"April 15, 2016",85

Efudex,  Actinic Keratosis," I am a 70 year old male who suffers from Actinick Keratosis from exposure to the harsh rays of the sun. Efudex is a fantastic product. Does exactly what is claimed. Make sure that you wash your hands completely after each application. Do not get it on your lips or you will experience great discomfort, (cracked and bleeding lips). Once you have completed the process (twice a day for 21 days), use Hydroval Cream 0.2% to assist in the healing process (works great).”",10,"October 12, 2015",137
Efudex,  Keratosis," This is the best!!   I've been using it for 4 years and it is absolutely the best solution for AK's.  I am 60 years old, fair skin, been outside for years and developed way too many AK's, not to mention basal and squamous problems too.   For years, the dermatologist only used spot nitrogen and prescribed caramac.     I can only assume she didn't prescribe efudex because she needed the steady income stream from me and my insurance.     By chance I was having a physical from my family doctor.   He asked me when I was going to address my AK;s on forehead.   I told him I did, and he told me he could write me a prescription for medicine that solves it, efudex.  He did and I amazed at the ending results.  Yes, the efudex was painful, looked bad when it was working but results speak for them self”",10,"September 27, 2015",195

It is very mentally challenging to go through this, but I can assure you it is very much worth making the commitment to complete a full course of therapy.  It was absolutely amazing how clear, smooth, and clean my face looked about a month after stopping treatment (I used a topical steriod afterwards).  People actually thought I had some plastic surgery (face lift?).  I am at it again, just having completed my first week.

Side effects are bad: breaking out looks unsightly, itching makes you feel like you want to scratch off your skin. The best relief I have found is Tylenol for pain and Calendula Cream (Marigold Cream) for the relief of irritated skin.  That's keeping me sane and I am on week 4 overall: 16 days using medication the remainder trying to overcome side effects.  Good luck to everyone.  I still have more to go....”",9,"November 19, 2009",170
Efudex,  Keratosis," I tried the Traumeel another user suggested.  It did nothing to help with the pain.

I sleep on a beach towel over my sheets so the shedding and peeling are ""contained"".  It's the only way I don't itch throughout the night and even if I do, the roughness of the towel helps to get it off the skin.  Hope this helps. ”",10,"November 8, 2009",135

It is very mentally challenging to go through this, but I can assure you it is very much worth making the commitment to complete a full course of therapy.  It was absolutely amazing how clear, smooth, and clean my face looked about a month after stopping treatment (I used a topical steriod afterwards).  People actually thought I had some plastic surgery (face lift?).  I am at it again, just having completed my first week.  While I remain self-conscious about how bad I look, it bothers me much less because I know the outcome will be well worth it.  Hang in there!”",10,"December 15, 2009",158
Efudex,  Keratosis," This is my second time around with Efudex.  I swear by it for effectiveness.  Side effects are bad: breaking out looks unsightly, itching makes you feel like you want to scratch off your skin. The best relief I have found is Tylenol for pain and Calendula Cream (Marigold Cream) for the relief of irritated skin.  That's keeping me sane and I am on week 4 overall: 16 days using medication the remainder trying to overcome side effects.  Good luck to everyone.  I still have more to go....”",9,"November 19, 2009",170
Efudex,  Keratosis," I tried the Traumeel another user suggested.  It did nothing to help with the pain.  The only relief I have found so far is Tylenol, Extra Strength and Aquaphor once everything has been pulled to the surface.  Of course keeping the affected areas uncovered is a huge help.  I sleep on a beach towel over my sheets so the shedding and peeling are ""contained"".  It's the only way I don't itch throughout the night and even if I do, the roughness of the towel helps to get it off the skin.  Hope this helps. ”",10,"November 8, 2009",135
Efudex,  Keratosis," I ended up in the hospital with a very serious allergic reaction to Efudex. Started with nausea and diarrhea, went into hives, swelling in my lips, mouth, all over my body.

Efudex,  Keratosis, Efudex works great but is very painful and itchy after about two weeks. I tried many creams to relieve the symptoms between applications of the Efudex.

Efudex,  Skin Cancer," Before I started with Efudex I googled pictures and reviews, on seeing the pictures I decided to do one part of my face at a time, lip first and now I've just done 2 weeks on the right side of my face and I'm glad I did especially because I work in retail and the pain of feeling like you have cold sores all over your face, thank God for makeup is all I can say. I will do my right side once my left has healed and then my forehead followed by a micro dermabrasion. I think this product is amazing and the way it keeps working after you stop applying. Those who did your whole face all at once I take my hat off to you.”",10,"November 14, 2014",95

To those wanting to use Efudex, there are articles stating 1% /0.5% are better tolerated, compared with 5%. But Carac is magnitude more expensive. I guess the lower % is less irritating as normal cells are not absorbing as much. If you have deep growth, 5FU may cause significant inflammation/edema that may be excruciatingly painful .I found using oral Serrapeptase 120k Ux2(empty stomach) helps a lot in terms of managing inflammation and pain.

Efudex,  Skin Cancer," Efudex successfully combated skin abnormalities that my doctor had cancer concerns about. I used Efudex for ten days and then stopped because of blistering; they were small, but covered my face. It's been almost two months after my treatment and I still have an unsightly, coarse rash. The steriod cream I used five days afterwards eased the appearance of the rash, but because of concerns over skin thinning, I could not continue with the cream.”",5,"February 6, 2011",78
Efudex,  Keratosis," I'm an engineer, now in my 60s, and I have worked outside all my life. I have red hair and fair complexion you can imagine the skin damage I have accumulated in my lifetime.

This did NOT work for me gave me a very mild ""sunburn"" with no apparent effect on the former skin damage and it was very expensive even after insurance coverage! I requested my treatment be changed to the proven Efudex my doctor insisted I stay with the ""blue light"", that my skin was ""in very good condition"" and that I only needed ""maintenance"".

I use a dish towel with fringe to flap against my face and that's the only relief I get. I forget how awful I look until I catch myself in a mirror.”,10,"January 3, 2015",130
Efudex,  Skin Cancer," Before I started with Efudex I googled pictures and reviews, on seeing the pictures I decided to do one part of my face at a time, lip first and now I've just done 2 weeks on the right side of my face and I'm glad I did especially because I work in retail and the pain of feeling like you have cold sores all over your face, thank God for makeup is all I can say. I will do my right side once my left has healed and then my forehead followed by a micro dermabrasion. I think this product is amazing and the way it keeps working after you stop applying. Those who did your whole face all at once I take my hat off to you.”",10,"November 14, 2014",95
Efudex,  Keratosis," Flouroracil 5% used on lower lip vermillion border for over a year.  Two biopsies confirmed actinic keratosis.  After application once a day for 4 days, lip would swell and ulcerate, then heal over 5 days.....lesion would return on day 6.  Repeated this over and over for one year.  Now going to participate in a study for Solaraze Gel.  Will report findings in three months.”",,"August 14, 2014",61
Efudex,  Skin Cancer," Im treating slightly raised warts which only partially respond to tea tree oil, EGCG cream, tazarotene and many herbal ointment containing thuja plus etc essential oils. To those wanting to use Efudex, there are articles stating 1% /0.5% are better tolerated, compared with 5%. But Carac is magnitude more expensive. I guess the lower % is less irritating as normal cells are not absorbing as much. If you have deep growth, 5FU may cause significant inflammation/edema that may be excruciatingly painful .I found using oral Serrapeptase 120k Ux2(empty stomach) helps a lot in terms of managing inflammation and pain. It seems the warts are responding dramatically”",,"February 5, 2014",41
Efudex,  Skin Cancer," Age 66 - spent many years at sea and as you can imagine my facial skin was a mess. Doctor put me on Ufedix (how it is called here) two weeks ago and the results are amazing. Of course it is not a pretty sight and sleeping is a bit difficult, the reaction was clearly pictured in the brochure that I was given at the clinic - but it does not truly describe the actual sensations associated with the inflamation. A little concerned I browsed for reviews and found this sight - after reading the experiences of other users I feel much releaved - thanks to all for sharing their experiences, now I am looking forward to seeing the end result. Stay safe and keep well. Thank you.”",,"May 4, 2013",187
Efudex,  Keratosis," Used the product on my face for 6 weeks twice a day for two days every week. Depending on the extent of sun damage, the effects are dramatic and nasty looking. After the 2nd week the treated area looks like a bad sun burn, it itches, peels, weeps, bleeds and burns. But the results after stopping for 3-4 weeks are very good.”",8,"March 5, 2013",162
Efudex,  Keratosis, Be careful not to exceed time period recommended otherwise there will be extreme redness and pain.  On the whole it seems to work but I have still got red skin after a few days without using it.  Doctor recommended following with Eumovate but I'm not too happy with results.”,,"August 2, 2012",68
Efudex,  Skin Cancer," Efudex successfully combated skin abnormalities that my doctor had cancer concerns about. I used Efudex for ten days and then stopped because of blistering; they were small, but covered my face. It's been almost two months after my treatment and I still have an unsightly, coarse rash. The steriod cream I used five days afterwards eased the appearance of the rash, but because of concerns over skin thinning, I could not continue with the cream.”",5,"February 6, 2011",78
Efudex,  Keratosis," I'm an engineer, now in my 60s, and I have worked outside all my life. I have red hair and fair complexion you can imagine the skin damage I have accumulated in my lifetime. I had used the Efudex 5% cream years ago and had good results. Three months ago I began seeing a dermatologist that recommended the ""new"" technology ""BLUE LIGHT TREATMENTS"". This did NOT work for me gave me a very mild ""sunburn"" with no apparent effect on the former skin damage and it was very expensive even after insurance coverage! I requested my treatment be changed to the proven Efudex my doctor insisted I stay with the ""blue light"", that my skin was ""in very good condition"" and that I only needed ""maintenance"".
As you may guess I have changed physicians and now I am being treated with Efudex again. My skin is now in full reaction after only two weeks treatment with Efudex. Yes with Efudex your skin is unsightly and uncomfortable from week 2 through to week 4; but, this is a small price to be cancer free. Efudex works! ”",9,"November 14, 2010",232
Efudex,Keratosis,"			 I am currently using Efudex for the second time.  My first experience was 11 years ago.  The issues were exactly as shared by many others.  I was a mess!  It is very mentally challenging to go through this, but I can assure you it is very much worth making the commitment to complete a full course of therapy.  It was absolutely amazing how clear, smooth, and clean my face looked about a month after stopping treatment (I used a topical steriod afterwards).  People actually thought I had some plastic surgery (face lift?).  I am at it again, just having completed my first week.  While I remain self-conscious about how bad I look, it bothers me much less because I know the outcome will be well worth it.  Hang in there!”",10,"December 15, 2009",158
Efudex,  Keratosis," This is my second time around with Efudex.  I swear by it for effectiveness.  Side effects are bad: breaking out looks unsightly, itching makes you feel like you want to scratch off your skin. The best relief I have found is Tylenol for pain and Calendula Cream (Marigold Cream) for the relief of irritated skin.  That's keeping me sane and I am on week 4 overall: 16 days using medication the remainder trying to overcome side effects.  Good luck to everyone.  I still have more to go....”",9,"November 19, 2009",170
Efudex,  Keratosis," I tried the Traumeel another user suggested.  It did nothing to help with the pain.  The only relief I have found so far is Tylenol, Extra Strength and Aquaphor once everything has been pulled to the surface.  Of course keeping the affected areas uncovered is a huge help.  I sleep on a beach towel over my sheets so the shedding and peeling are ""contained"".  It's the only way I don't itch throughout the night and even if I do, the roughness of the towel helps to get it off the skin.  Hope this helps. ”",10,"November 8, 2009",135
Efudex,  Keratosis," I ended up in the hospital with a very serious allergic reaction to Efudex. Started with nausea and diarrhea, went into hives, swelling in my lips, mouth, all over my body. I have been out of the hospital for a week my voice is still hoarse, I still have a rash not feeling well at all. I'm on Prednisone to counteract the allergic reaction.”",1,"November 3, 2009",110
Efudex,  Keratosis, Efudex works great but is very painful and itchy after about two weeks. I tried many creams to relieve the symptoms between applications of the Efudex. One cream that REALLY helped was Traumeel. What a sanity saver. Just thought I would pass this on for others to get some relief. I hope it can help you too.”,10,"July 12, 2009",165
Efudex,  Keratosis," Efudex works great to eliminate actinic keratosis. I have used it before and unfortunately am using it again. It becomes VERY unsightly.. blotchy, swollen, very painful, etc, but it works.”",9,"February 12, 2009",177
Efudex,  Skin Cancer," This product works very well to eliminate skin cancers.
It becomes quite irritating after a few days, and very irritating at about 10 days, but it gets rid of the skin cancer in a couple of weeks.”",9,"September 25, 2008",212
Tretenion-tropical,Acne," Started this and I’m just hopeful as I cannot see any results yet.
Rather my acne has gotten terribly worse than it was . I’m still giving it time like they said”",5,"November 14, 2020",3
Tretenion-tropical,  Photoaging of the Skin," I wanted to go on to share my experience. I started off with 0.025 and 0.05 and my skin did ok. Had some initial flakiness, but moisturizer helped and it eventually improved. My dermatologist upped me to 0.1% and things took a turn for the worse. About two weeks after I began using it, my skin got really red and itchy, and I developed diarrhea which turned bloody. I had to go to the ER, thinking I had something terrible wrong and it turned out that high dosage (0.1%) of Tretinoin was the culprit. Once I got off it, my GI symptoms went away and the redness of skin went away. So proceed with caution. The lower dosage of 0.05% did improve the appearance of my skin.”",2,"October 29, 2020",4
Tretenion-tropical,  Photoaging of the Skin," 33 y/o male here. I've been using tretinoin 0.05% for just over a month now. I have yet to have any negative side effects I've read about from others; this had me wondering if Walgreens gave me a fake Rx haha. I haven't had any peeling, sensitivity or any type of reaction :: fingers crossed :: That being said, I have been using it every night by itself and then moisturing in the a.m. and putting on Strivectin's clear sunblock everyday before I go out. I'm hoping I won't have any purge as I've gone this long without any negative side effects. I can't help but wonder if the fact I follow a keto diet and take supplements keeps the purge at bay? Perhaps many people have a bad or prolonged purge due to their diet? Try it and see if a change helps since we know sugar induces AGEs (Advanced Glycation End products affecting collage)!”",9,"October 14, 2020",2
Tretenion-tropical,Acne, I have been on this for 5 months. I originally tried adapalene and broke into blisters and a rash and was hesitant to try another similar product. My derm said the retin-A was gentler and to start slow and do what I can tolerate. I used it every third day for two weeks and then every other day and continue every other day. I also use aczone but aczone was not effective on its own. My skin is almost completely clear. I don't even use it daily and have not felt this good in a while. I am so happy and can only imagine I will continue to see results. Consistency is key. Best acne product I have ever tried! Finally something that works.”,10,"October 5, 2020",6
Tretenion-tropical,Acne, This cream is absolutely awful!!! Just a thin covering made my the skin on my whole face peel off more than 6 times and it’s still doing it one week later!!!”,1,"August 24, 2020",8
Tretenion-tropical,Acne," 33 yo/female. Had acne since I was 13 yo. Was diagnosed with PCOS. Took birth control for about 15 years also Spironolactone. My acne is very persistent and mainly comedonal especially jaw line/cheeks/upper neck. I stopped birth control and was tired of Spironolactone as taken alone it didn't do much for me. Went on Accutane which was a horrible experience to clear my acne for it to come back just 6 months later. Have been using Retin A 0.01% for 2.5 months and I can see a lot of improvement. My skin is still purging as it's really congested but I can see it's improving gradually and clearing up. It was a real mess in the first 6 weeks. I'm getting less painful acne around my jaw area now and my skin is much softer, the scars are also fading. Will continue the treatment for the rest of my life I believe. Highly recommend it to anyone with hormonal acne who doesn't want to take medication.”",10,"August 21, 2020",26
Tretenion-tropical,Acne," Retin A..wow is all I can say. This product is amazing. I had small stubborn little bumps (clogged pores) and just overall comedonal acne. Retin A has completely cleared my skin and made it look even better than it did before I had acne. My skin so smooth and it just continues to boost my skin confidence. I've been on Retin A for about a year and hse  Retin A micro pump gel 0.06%”.  I did purge a lot and had SLIGHT dryness/irration in the beginning but I didn’t mind it because I WANTED to get rid of the small bumps that were clogged pores. MY TOP ADVICE about this product is using it consistently! This product works slowly (but effectively) and will take some time to produce the wonderful results. Also, I still get a pimple occasionally but no where near what I had. The pimple will usually come and go quickly with this product. I use a mosturizer and a good SPF sunscreen. This is the BEST so stick it out during the purging phase because it is WORTH IT.”",10,"August 1, 2020",21
Tretenion-tropical,  Photoaging of the Skin," I have almost a year since I am using Retin A and let me tell you that at the beginning its rough. When you just begin using it, start with 0.025%, and once in 3 days, after 2-3 weeks do it once in 2 days, and always watch your skin, how does it feel.  If it's ok, after about a month you can use it every night.  If you will peel like a snake  - YES, if it might feel like burning or sensitive  -YES. But don't give up, I promise it is worth it.  It's not going to pay off instantly, but in time you will see an improvement of your skin. Remember to use SPF on your face  everyday, because Retin-A peels off the first layer of your skin, and it's very delicate.  Put your moisturizer at night, after applying Retin A, and in the morning before SPF. After about 7 months I switched to 0.05. My skin is glowing. And everyone thinks I'm 21, but I'm 31. I swear its WORTH IT.”",10,"July 23, 2020",20
Tretenion-tropical,  Acne, I applied it at night and 2 weeks only gets worst. Feel like giving up”,2,"June 29, 2020",17
Tretenion-tropical,  Acne, So I read the reviews and most were bad but I also read good ones. I decided to give tretinoin  a chance and I can honestly say that this tretinoin cream is not for me. I had a severe allergic reaction around my lips and nose . And I have been purging like crazy. When I started this I only had like 3 pimples and smaller ones and hyperpigmentation. I thought maybe the allergic reaction will go away and it has not it burns a lot and I'm seeing my dermatologist on Tuesday and hopefully I get something better but this is just my personal experience it may have not worked for me but it can work for you”,1,"June 14, 2020",9
Tretenion-tropical,  Acne," The first few weeks you feel like giving up. Made my skin look very shiny in a weird way, peeling was hard to cover and the initial purge sucked. That said, like everyone has mentioned on here, it gets better. The purge is cleaning you out, so keep this perspective. I did not feel good about my skin during that time, but so glad I stuck with it. I'm now at week 9 and have 3-4 pimples on my face, skin is super smooth and looks really glowy. Every day keeps getting better. I'm still peeling on and off but its less than it used to be.  Just ease in slowly so you don't get crazy red or peely. I did about 2-3 a week to start and now at 4x a week. Love that this gets rid of hyperpigmentation quickly.”",9,"June 4, 2020",22
Tretenion-tropical,Photoaging of the Skin," If you stick it out and are patient with this - the results are incredible. One piece of advice is moisturize!!! A LOT!! The gel is way better than the cream imo. The gel burns so bad though whereas the cream didn't. I've been using retin-a since February and it's May now and I have the worst purge I've ever had but now my skin is flawless. Stick it out. Amazing for tightening pores, clearing acne, and just gives your skin an overall healthy look to it. 10/10 be patient”",10,"May 14, 2020",22
Tretenion-tropical,  Acne," I started tretinoin 0.025 about a week ago for moderate teenage acne. So far, no new breakouts. Face is peeling but not super dry if you know what I mean. I have always had sensitive skin as well so my face is more red and splotchy than usual. I am using every other day after shower and Cerave moisturizer. Seems to be helping so far. Will update each week!”",10,"April 30, 2020",13
Tretenion-tropical,Acne," prior to using this cream, I checked reviews. I saw a lot of negatives; people complaining about a face-purge. I was highly discouraged. After a while, I said screw it. I’ve been struggling with acne for a long time now. I’m a 22 year old african male, been struggling with acne since I was 11; that is half of my life. I ignored the negatives and decided to give it a shot. Week 1 and 2 were calm. The purge started on week 3 and it was  horrible! I couldn’t leave my house, my face was a mess. I was nearly compelled to quit but I persevered.  The purge lasted through till week 8. On the 9th week, I noticed little less break outs. I’m on my 11 week now and man! my face is as smooth as a baby’s. I honestly can’t believe this. This is the best my face has been in more than a decade. I'd highly recommend. The purge period is absolutely hectic and discouraging but do not give up. stick to it I promise. advice: Take pictures to track your progress”",9,"April 29, 2020",61
Tretenion-tropical,Acne," Before trying this product I honestly lost all hope, I tried everything. Then my doctor prescribed me Stieva-A and after about a month my skin instantly cleared up, I couldn’t believe it actually worked for me. It’s even helped to slowly fade my acne scars, my face hasn’t felt this smooth in a while, also a bonus is when I apply makeup now, it’s sooooo smooth. I just got a second refill on this product because I love it so much and want to use it for a year and see how much it can help my scars fade. Also a little bit goes along way which is nice !”",8,"April 24, 2020",13
Tretenion-tropical,Acne," When I was 5 weeks into using this topical Retin-A I headed to the internet to figure out why my acne was 5 times WORSE than when I started it. I would honesty just look in the mirror and cry, I picked at all my pimples and it made it even worse. The purge is real but If you can make it past it I promise it’s worth it. Do some research on why the purge happens. I am 10 weeks in and all that I have on my face is scaring due to the picking which will go away over time and with the help of other topicals. My advice is to stick with it, do not pick and trust the process!”",8,"April 22, 2020",24
Tretenion-tropical,Acne," I have acne-prone skin and started having acne 12-ish. I have done extensively research on effective medication and found Retin-A. I introduced RetinA to my skin, really slowly by applying for 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120min and washing it off before my normal routine for 1week each (2min for 1week, 5min for 1week & go on). Then I started apply it overnight as my last step (moisturizer 30min then RetinA 0.025) from 1night/week to every other night then every night. I am on my 8th week of using RetinA every night as my last step. I am going to use it before moisturizer in week10. Gradually introduce RetinA to my skin made the purging bearable (slowly purging) and subsided those side effects. I still have red scars but much smoother texture, little bumpy. I am still breaking out but expecting. Complexion is improving. Skin is brighten and glowing. Skin is more balance, not oily, not dry. I am on month2 and happy with my skin, not perfect, much better. RetinA is worth your patience.”",10,"April 17, 2020",14

If any area was super irritated I put aquafor on it was healed over night. The first 2-5 weeks my skin broke out worse than before I started using, however the pimples were smaller than usual and would clear up quickly. Weeks 6-7 my skin looked like it was finally clearing up with the exception of two stubborn areas. Those areas didn’t improve in this time but didn’t get worse. Weeks 8-10 my the two problem areas cleared up almost completely but unfortunately I was left with hyperpigmentation. I had minor breakouts on my chin. Weeks 10-12 breakouts stopped. No more purging. Skin clear with the exception of blackheads on nose and chin. Weeks 13-16 still have the blackheads although they seem to be dissipating. Skin texture feels AWESOME. Still have the hyperpigmentation on my cheeks. All in all I LOVE this stuff.”",10,"February 19, 2020",21

I  applied moisturizer on face at day time in night before sleeping I use this cream on pimples in very little amount . I'm applying this from 1 month ago and it's really working on my pimples my pimples get reduced and my dark spot also get lighten. It's taking time so you have to be patient and you have to apply on face where you feel like that pimples are coming also but their no need to worry it recover new pimples also and treated whole face with pimpels it's remove pimples very easily.

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," If you're suffering with androgenic alopecia or another form of hair loss then DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF. I have been using minoxidil 5% (the active ingredient in Rogaine and all that's happened is I've lost too much money and too much hair. This is because I stopped using it for a week by accident and as a result my hairline shot up higher than it ever had, and when I read about how 2x a day isn't necessary I cut down my usage which resulted in another fairly immediate loss of hair. Now I have to style my hair in a specific way and even that doesn't adequately cover up my patches of baldness. This product has not grown a single new hair for me and is nothing but a scam. It was also proven to be as effective as rosemary oil in a study but without the side effects. I wish I had never bought this awful product.”",1,"December 7, 2020",1
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I am using this for thinning hair. I got side effect of severe hives, severe facial edema and pustular dermatitis of the scalp. It 10 days since onset and symptoms slowly going away. Hives are tiny fluid filled bumps that itch. Dr prescribed a steroid for the swelling. The steriod meds may have helped somewhat but my face especially around the eyes are still swollen. The scalp cleared fastest. First 3 days were horrible. The entire contact site was sore, swollen, oozed and formed a thick layer. The swelling literally traveled down my face starting at my hairline. Again stalling out around my eyes. Benedryl and ice application helps with the itching. Hives are central to my hands (front and back), forearms, face and ears. But it appears to be spreading to my neck. I was impressed with the results after 6 months of use so I decided to use a little bit more about half a dropper. After 3 weeks of increase the above happened.

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," Minoxidil shouldn’t be sold without a prescription and a consult with a doctor. It definitely works for many but there are endless horror stories of way more harm than good. I’m a 50yr old male who had 85-90% of the hairline & density I had in my 20’s and used it for prevention only with finasteride that I’ve used for years. Surely a product sold beside the J&J baby shampoo wouldn't hurt your hair and do the exact opposite of what it’s supposed to right? All I got was shedding from month 3 to 7 until I ultimately quit. The catch all statements like  it won’t make you lose more hair than you otherwise would have lost”, or  the hair you lose after quitting is only the hair that minox regrew” are not true in my case. These assertions conveniently blame pattern baldness for the negative experiences. I’ve lost more hair in 7 months than I had in the last 20yrs and it’s been a devastating experience. If you have decent hair do your research before you use it.”",1,"October 28, 2020",6

I was a 19 year old body builder and college level track athlete when I decided to start Minoxidil. After 2 weeks of use I quit because it was causing me intense chest pain and shortness of breath any time I would exercise. I have seen 4 cardiologists and 1 pulmonologist, and the only things that  they have found are a right to left shunt and high bilirubin.

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," This Rogaine Men's Extra Strength medication caused my face to swell and my hands / feet.   It causes excruciating headaches and makes your head fill as though it weights 5 pounds.  It causes irregular and rapid heartbeats, some nausea/vomiting.  In the area applied it takes the color from your hair and leaves it ""gray"".  It causes you to feel dizzy , like faint and fatigue    with cold chill intermittently.

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," Ok so Rogaine gets a lot of hate because people claim that it increases hairloss. Which yes it does! However the shedding early on is a normal part of the hair strengthening process and it will regrow, and likely as stronger and thicker hair. But you have to be patient with it. Don't give up after a couple months because it feels like you've lost hair. It takes time and many people quit at the first sign of hair shedding. For Androgenetic alopecia it can be very helpful. Granted not as beneficial as finasteride or other topical agents.  (In conjunction very useful) However it will almost certainly result in some growth as long as you have living follicles. Derma rolling can help increase the absorption and therefore increase results from Rogaine. I noticed new hair growth in the first 2 months. They started out small, but over time they grew darker, thicker and longer. It works! But you must keep using it for results or the hairs will fall.”",9,"June 9, 2020",21
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," Was using the liquid minoxidil years ago. Burnt my scalp, caused itching, burning. Some growth.

Later, in my late 50s, bought the minoxidil foam for women.  Again, it caused itching, burning, scabs. Worse of all, I lost all my own hair (huge bald spots) on only the areas that I used the product. My follicles were damaged and my hair never grew back. So much regrets. I would not recommend it to anyone. When I reported my experience to Johnson and Johnson, they downplayed my experience because ""no one has ever complained of those experiences before.""  Really?”",1,"June 4, 2020",21
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I started using minoxidil from all the positive reviews I saw online, but shortly afterwards I noticed little improvement. In my bald spots after 6 months I had nothing, but now I have peach fuzz. My dermatologist argued with me and said the topical application was working but I said otherwise. After 6 months my bald spots had started developing a wide range of texture. My doctor said the application was producing small hairs and said I do continued using minoxidil they would turn into thicker full sized hairs. My dermatologist said after review under a microscope said over 100 hairs were growing on my temple. I was surprised. My crown area had completely been covered but Im still dissatisfied. Would definitely not recommend, takes too long. My wife told me to continue the medication as it was fairly cheap and I had no side effects. I guess it wouldn’t hurt to listen to my wife once in a while, she was never wrong to me.”",3,"April 1, 2020",11
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I started using this medication for like 8 months ago and it did show changes on my scalp , I was not very faithful since I actually skipped some days we all know keeping up with medication is tough. Since I was skipping medication here I am again my hair kind of looks lost again. I guess one should be stuck with medication in order to have full hair.”",6,"February 12, 2020",7

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," After a few months I definitely had hair growth. I put it on in the bald spots. Guess what? The bald spots grow courser, nasty, tough to style, thick, curly hair. Now the sides of my face have that nasty hair, along with the crown line. I'm going to stop using it. I would rather have sending hair then clown hair”",5,"November 26, 2019",26
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I am a man with the start of male pattern baldness and have been using minoxidil for 6 weeks and have noticed new growth in the crown area and a bit forward.  The baldness is slowly disappearing from side to side. I am using 5% solution 2 X a day. Morning and after shower.  I would recommend this product, but you have to make sure you use it consistently as directed. I will come back when I have reached the 6 month of usage. This is supposed to be the time when you see the most hair growth. Also, I use a DHT blocking shampoo twice daily.”",8,"November 18, 2019",22
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," Has anyone experienced the growth of FACIAL HAIR?
I have been using Rogaine for almost 2 months now. The hair loss has improved a little (I am still losing it but less than before), I know it's a slow process, and I am willing to continue, but after about 1 month, I have noticed some hair growth on my cheekbones and temples and on my chin! I am a female in my mid sixties.”",7,"November 10, 2019",29

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I started using minoxidil in my 40s when it was prescription only. I still had pretty much a full head of hair then and still do at 73. I have always used it on my temples and vortex and both have stayed the same. I have friends with more hair loss who used it with little success. My conclusion is if you start using it at the first noticeable sign, you can possibly have a good outcome. If it's pretty much gone, don't waste your money.”",8,"September 24, 2019",19
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning, When I would go to the beach the top of my scalp got sunburned and my hair just felt thinner overall when I washed it. When I would get a haircut and the barber would wet my hair you could clearly see my scalp. Became extremely self conscious. Heard about 5% Rogaine and  saw a generic brand (Kirkland) advertised so I decided to make the commitment and order a 6 month supply of the liquid formula. I've had no side effects. I am happy to report that ALL of my hair is growing back after 4 1/2 months of being on it. My hair is feeling and looking thick like it did years ago.  I have a ton of new hair across my hairline in the front where it was thin and receding and at the crown.  I'm actually shocked at how much hair in 4.5 months has grown in. I use it faithfully morning and night and in the 4 1/2 months have not missed a day. I can't wait to see the results in 12 months. I know that everyone is different but this has made an enormous difference in the way my hair looks and feels.”,,"August 20, 2019",61
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," Please ignore most negative reviews as they are normally individuals who have not used this product long enough or most importantly, correctly. Missing even 1 dose gives you a major setback of days. 
Initially, I used minoxidil topical solution 5%. I found this medication to be nil effective at this time, first time round. However, like any normal person- I did not use this medication religiously and applied it once a day at night as I couldn't style my hair if I applied in the morning. Sometimes I would miss a day. I stopped using topical solution due to inconvenience. 

I used the minoxidil tablets (10mg) and they were highly effective. Stopped due to too much hair growth across body. I used finasteride, didn't like the side effects and possible long term damage. 

Used topical 5% again, worked when I used it religiously twice a day, and this means twice a day. Not once, not every second day or sometimes miss a dose. EVERY DOSE IS IMPORTANT”",10,"July 30, 2019",41
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I had slight thinning of my hair, nothing serious.   The dermatologist suggested I try Rogaine.   Big mistake.   The places I put Rogaine kept on getting worse and worse.   It made the shedding worse and created bald spots.   I knew to expect some extra shedding in the beginning but never to the extent it is now.    It ruined my hair and I’m scared I’ll never get it back.   Please only use if it is a last resort.”",1,"July 28, 2019",46
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," Have been using minoxidil this product for a little more than 2 months. In the last 6 weeks, about half the hair where I apply it has fallen out, and about 75% of hair at the hairline has fallen out, where I previously had no issues (I am a diffuse thinner). Everyday I look in the mirror, I wish I had not started this product, because my hair was not that bad before it. It has caused me so much anxiety to see most of my hair fall out in only one month, only where I apply this medication. Even if it does grow back these 2.5 months of pain are not worth it. Please do not use this product!”",1,"May 20, 2019",31
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning, I do not recommend this product to use for a thinning widows peak i reckon the stuff actually gave me alopecia and I know this for a fact because all the areas I started using rogaine are now the spots I have big bald patches. I sought rogaine to help save my hair and instead it has destroyed it. I may never get my follicles back again.”,2,"April 4, 2019",54
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," Always had very fine fair hair, started to thin in late thirties, became quite noticeable early sixties.  Doctor suggested Rogaine for women, once a day foam.  Within 3 months had noticeable improvement, new fine hair covered bare spot in front.  No side effects, no itching.  Good product and reasonable cost.”",7,"February 27, 2019",41
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," Rogaine works better than nothing.  It works pretty well for the first 9 mos - 1 year and then it really slows down. It seems that the Rogaine hair falls out if you forget to use it for a few days, and then starts again as soon as you start using it again.   They also have these stickers on the women's liquid boxes advertising a $10 or $25 refund.  Don't believe it!  They never pay and if you contact them about it, they say they will do it, but again never pay you the refund. Don't buy it based on the refund.”",5,"February 3, 2019",21

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," My hair has been falling out since college - I'm 74.  Although it falls out, it seems to regrow but at a declining rate and is now thinning.  I thought it was hormonal and have asked every doctor I see - GYM, Dermo, Cardio, Primary.  Finally my rheumatologist said to try Rogaine. [She uses it.]  The instructions say that results may not be apparent for 4 months.  I've used it once to twice per day for 1 1/2 weeks, and my hair has stopped falling out!!  I'm amazed!  When I brush my hair in the morning, there are 1-2 hairs in my brush rather than a handful.  Thank you, Rogaine!”",10,"January 8, 2019",31

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," After a month of minoxidil 5% use I've experienced erectile dysfunction, complete loss of sensitivity in the penis, zero libido, extreme weight gain, facial bloating, persistent tachycardia, swollen throat glands and thyroid, bloodshot eyes, problems with digestion and dark circles under my eyes. Most of the side effects have gone but the sexual dysfunction has persisted 3 months after stopping the treatment. Minoxidil is just as dangerous as Finasteride, beware and never touch this stuff. It has recently been proven to block the 5ARII and also severely suppress androgen receptors. If you think it's only a topical that can do no harm, please consider that just a couple of miligrams that are absorbed systemically can do that. Wish I could give this -10/10. It needs to be banned.”",1,"August 17, 2018",33

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," 21 year old male with slowly progressing MPB since 20s. Used once daily 5% for 4 months and shedding was reduced. No objective data about effectiveness but I would say it reduced shedding and progression a little.  Stopped due to palpitations and chest discomfort (not any other side effect). My advice is to keep in mind this is a long term treatment and increased shedding could be seen the first month (my case). Another thing to remind is that effectiveness can only be appreciated within 4 to 6 months of usage. 

Decided to stop slowly for two months and then stop completely. Approximately 2 months have passed since no minoxidil and shedding had increased a lot, but seems to be more stable now (as it was before starting any treatment). Keep in mind any result obtained WILL BE LOST AFTER 3 Months. Thinking about starting finasteride, but luckily not in a hurry. Best of luck to all the balding men reading.”",5,"January 29, 2018",12
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I started having male pattern baldness. I starting losing hair in my 20s and I could clearly see that my hair was going for good, but I knew I was still in time if I could find something that could keep it, I didn't need anything for regrowth, only for it to stop falling. And that's what minoxidil did for me, I didn't get more hair, but I kept all my hair and it got thicker and now the hairs that fall have a root again. I'm 26 now and I can say that without minoxidil I would be bald because at 23 I was 3 months without it and it starting falling LIKE CRAZY... I guess I will use it forever or until something better comes”",10,"January 26, 2018",10

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I started Rogaine and Propecia about a year ago. I apply Rogaine 2x a day morning and night. I have noticed thickening of my hair and I do have a 6 month before and after picture my dermatologist took. She said I am her ""poster child"" for this treatment... we were both very excited! I have absolutely no noticeable side effects from either medication. Sex drive is the same as it was before medication. I also use Regenpure DR, NT, and conditioner. I wash my hair once daily as it is needed because the Rogaine foam creates a stiffness of my hair (like gel would if applied) and I have a problem w/ dandruff. My dermatologist prescribed me triamcinolone acetonide lotion to help with itchiness which I apply with a Qtip. (1/2)”",8,"July 30, 2017",40
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I used it for 4 months. Between months 3 and 4, my libido was completely gone, my penis smaller, and my erection quality terrible.....in the rare case I was able to achieve one. Its now been almost 5 months since stopping the drug and all my side effects remain with no improvement. This over the counter hair loss medicine has made me asexual. I saw the endocrinologist and he believes that minoxidil caused these side effects. There is a research article titled ""minoxidil may suppress hormone receptor functions"" published in 2014. He believes that my androgen receptors have been suppressed and that is why my hormone tests are all normal. Unfortunately there is no treatment besides discontinuing the drug and waiting x months/years...if ever.”",1,"July 22, 2017",27

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning, I originally used the liquid twice a day but switched to the once a day foam when it came out - the foam was pretty useless to me because the majority of the stuff just got stuck through my hair rather than getting on my scalp.

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning, For people not getting results. If you're a woman it says specifically it is not for women & female rogaine I believe 2 be a gimmick because DHT causes most hair loss & this has 2 do with testosterone I think something else is needed for females (since this is for genetic hair loss & involves testosterone & most female hair loss is neither of these). For men saying it doesn't work try tapping it on (grabbing by circular plastic part not the rubber squeezer. Don't massage it on because you lose about half of it (unless its foam because it doesn't have the propylene glycol which is used in the liquid to penetrate the scalp and is what also probably causes the flakes/residue in the liquid form). Also use 4 @ least 3-6 months or even a year for max results.”,,"May 30, 2017",9

I simply cannot believe that this poison has not been removed from the market or asexuality mentioned as a possible outcome of this. I have no idea when I will recover and if I will recover.

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," This product works very well. I've been using it for the past 3 years and it has been a life saver. It's restored most of the thickness I had before I began losing my hair.

I haven't got enough hair to spare. Well the shed never happened and after a full year of faithful application, nothing else did either so I give up.

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I started using the men's 5% about a year ago when it was recommended by my dermatologist. I was losing handfuls of hair in shower and when combing. My part became so wide and the crown of my head had thinned drastically. I became depressed and it was all I could think about. I decided to try the Minoxidil. After three months I really noticed a difference. I had lots of new growth and my hair loss stopped. Now the thinning is no where as noticeable as it once was. My hair dresser told me I had lots of new growth and that my hair felt so much thicker. The only negatives are that I do have an increase in facial hair that I have to deal with often and that some of the regrowth is course. Even with those, I would not discontinue using it.”",9,"September 2, 2016",25

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," Hi, I had started minoxidil 5 on 19th Jun along with dutasteride and follihair tablets. The results as on date i.e., 9th aug are visible specially on temples. Plenty of small brown hairs on both sides and on the forehead hairline. I am using it twice a day (Minza), 5 sprays each and taking the other medicines once daily. 

In the mid, I used Tugain but because of the alcohol content it reacted badly on my skin, given rashes and swelling on face. Now, I'm back on 'Minza 5 - No alcohol' and this is fab. No sideeffects, except a bit of scalp irritation.

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I startd suffering from male pattern baldness at age of 19 . I visited doc who prescribed me finax 1 mg tablet (one tablet per day) and minoxidil for one month.  My hair stopped falling immediatley. I took finax for 3 more months then discontinued it since it has chance of some side effects though the chance of side effect is RARE. I felt some sort of pain in my testicle while having finax for more than 3-4 month although doctor said finax is not the reason and it is safe to continue it.  After stopping finax my testicle pain also vanished. But Finax is good for stoping hair fall and it was fast.  Minoxidil (5%, me using brand named as TINFAL) is best for regrowing hair. It really works if applied twice daily. If any side effect, consult doc.”",10,"June 5, 2016",26

The 2003 blog said it would take between 1-2 months to be completely out of your system.  I would recommend anyone with high blood pressure, to stay away from it.”",1,"March 11, 2016",45

So I went to a major pharmacy and retail chain and purchased the generic Rogain extra strength. For the first month there was no change. But I heard that it really doesn't start working until the second month of applying it to your scalp. 

Next week is officially month two. I applied Rogaine twice a day, once in the morning, and once before I went to bed. 

This last week I noticed more hair growth. It works. Granted it wasn't like I suddenly had the hair of a 15 year old boy. Where my hair was thinning it has grown in and the folicles appear thicker.

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," This was recommended by my dermatologist. I've been using rogaine for about ten years, I think I am getting  results so l have stuck with it for so long. Although it improves the health of the thinning areas and may even slow down the process of male pattern baldness, l don't see any hard evidence that dead hair follicles are revitalized. In fact it is my belief that once a hair follicle dies, like anything else, it dies. l'm 59, and l believe my hair still looks good feels good and the balding process has been at the very least slowed to an acceptable level.”",,"February 11, 2016",18

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," 31yrs old, single. Slowly been losing hair for 10 years, but last couple years very noticeable.  It makes me very self conscious because I was always the best looking guy most places I would go,but I was starting to feel ugly, lost my swag and its all because of hair loss.  I think about it 24/7 of everyday.  I've tried everything to try and stop it from serums, the lasercomb, propecia.   5 months ago I decided I would try one last thing or just accept my thining head of hair and hope I would find a girl that was ok with the top of my head turning into a horseshoe of baldness.  I had an initial shed which was tough to go through but I can tell its working and I am so happy, I will continue with it and hope it keeps getting better.”",10,"September 22, 2015",47
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I have been using rogaine foam for 4 months. It is unbelievable how much this stuff has worked for me, it took 4 months to really be able to tell.

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I have had an amazing experience with the introduction of minoxidil to my hair loss regiment. I use this medication in conjunction with, Saw Palmetto (oral), Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) and biotin. The laser and Saw Palmetto was effective in curbing the loss and gaining some slow regrowth. I noticed a huge spike in re growth and my hairline returned to normal after 3 months on minoxidil. The over all volume, density and hair strength has changed. Also, the amount of hair I lose now is minimal with the minoxidil added. I have been suffering from mild AG for about 2 years. Luckily, the minoxidil was the master at getting all of my hair back. The other treatments helped but the minoxidil is the work horse.”",8,"April 6, 2015",80
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning, I have had thin fine hair all my life then at 55 my hairdresser said I was losing it. I got rogaine and wish now I had 20 years ago. My hair is thicker from more hair. I use men because it is 5%. Show me a study anywhere that women's rogaine needs to be lower. The assumption they make is it will drop womens BP too much. In fact I have high blood pressure take medicine for it and the 5% has given me nothing but full hair. I started using it 5 months ago and started getting results showing at 2 months. I had a friend that I could see her scalp and she started on 5%.  It is about 5 weeks and already her scalp is getting better.

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I have only been using Rogaine for two months now, but I can tell that it is working. A few things I have learned: do not overuse this product! Stick to the 1 ml regardless if you have hair loss all over or not! It's not worth the side effects. I wasn't sure how much to be applying because I know they say only use 1 ml, but since I have diffuse thinning all over, I feel like I need to apply it in back as well. Anyway I am going to use less of it and try to apply more evenly. I hear that it works all over regardless of how much you apply, hope this is true.

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning, Fantastic- you can no longer see my scalp in the front. I am going to try it on my eyebrows!  It's not often a product works as promised- but it did for me. I lost hair at 50 and am now 54. I will continue to use Rogaine for women.”,9,"November 11, 2011",122
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," Did not work well in the spots where I rubbed, but noticed extra rapid growth of facial hair, nose hair, eye brows and ear hair. A few unpigmented hairs grew on hairline where it was one full, but they were not very strong/healthy. ”",4,"January 29, 2011",85

Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," I started treatment 6 months ago and have been rubbing this on my head twice daily. I have new hair growing on the top of my head and it is noticeable although it is very thin (partly because I'm blond). As for the front right and left I can see white peach fuzz. Overall for me and I stress me the cost vs results are unbalanced. I would recommend for others, as it does work but, takes a long time and is costly.”",8,"November 25, 2009",112
Minoxidil Topical,Hairline thinning," This product brought new growth. It took a little while but have regrown hair back and front.

Cardolvelil,Hypertension,Caused extreme fatigue,2,31-Jan-10,115
Cardolvelil,Hypertension,"This Medicine had no affect on my HBP.  I previously took Lisinopril, but needed to change medicines for another reason.  My BP went very high (160/110) even after taking this medicine for 7 days and I had to be changed to another medicine.‚Äù",,08-Dec-09,55
Cardolvelil,Hypertension,I have had very little side effects. I am at my third increase in dosage and am at 12.5mg. I wished it had been more effective at the lower dose.‚Äù,7,24-Sep-09,39
Cardolvelil,Hypertension,"Blood pressure never went below 176/110, even with atenolol.  Using Coreg 80 and Exforge, BP 100/76, exercise 3 to 4 four time a week and feel very healthy.  No side effects. ‚Äù",,21-May-09,33
Cardolvelil,Hypertension,"Switched from Atenolol after many years due to usual beta blocker problems (tiredness, etc) and blood pressure wouldn't stay down long, tightness in chest and breathlessness. After 3 months on Coreg CR, tightness in chest much better, breathlessness no change, blood pressure stays down all day, but is 147/91 at night and in the morning. It is 113/57 two hours after medication, but I am also taking Isosorbide ER at the same time, which also lowers blood pressure as a side effect. Coreg CR is much more expensive, but I would rather take this anytime compared to Atenolol. Also beware of mixing these with Nasonex (no matter what they say) and any cold decongestants with phenylephrine. They will increase blood pressure.‚Äù",7,06-Apr-09,51
Cardolvelil,Hypertension,I am tired and dizzy with this medicine. ,3,31-Mar-09,125
Cardolvelil,Hypertension,"Switched from atenolol to Coreg CR to avoid the wall I would hit when doing cardio-exercise. I felt less of the wall from the cardiac side, but seemed to not breath as easily while doing cardio and while at rest. Felt like I had to force myself to take deep breaths on Coreg CR. Never had that happen with atenolol. Also, lost some libido on Coreg CR which wasn't an issue with atenolol. Switched back to atenolol and these issues all went away. ‚Äù",3,30-Jan-09,38
Cardolvelil,Hypertension,"For the past 18 months, I have experienced labile hypertension of unknown cause evidently unrelated to any underlying condition or risk factor. Coreg CR which I have been taking for approximately two months has provided great benefit in stabilizing my surges (from 100/50 to 200/100 in less than two hours). It is a beta blocker and provides some vasodilation.

Side effects to date include some shortness of breath, which reduces over time, and some dizziness and drowsiness/hypotension approximately 6 hours after administration. Taking 40 mg extended release form along with calcium channel blocker, clonidine patch, and diuretics.",9,25-Jan-09,21
